# Discussion questions for week 2: Users and Information Needs
 1. Connaway et al. consider a number of issues under the umbrella term "convenience." 
    Are any of these convenience issues rooted in problems more complicated than simple
    resource access and time requirements?
 2. Connaway et al. end their article with the recommendation that libraries emulate the
    resources that their patrons find convenient. If the authors' claims about user behavior
    are justified, are there other implications for practice beyond making library tools 
    more like Google and Amazon? 
 3. Does Ann Blair's JHI article put Bush's proposals in "As we may think" in a new light?
 4. The factors motivating people to reduce their information seeking effort are 
    discussed by Connaway et al. with respect to models of rational behavior, while Bawden
    and Robinson characterize the same factors as pathologies and paradoxes. To what extent
    is satisficing behavior simple a matter of human nature, and how much is it a response
    to ways life in the modern world is changing?
