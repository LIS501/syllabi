# Lab 6: Pandoc encoding and transformation {#Lab6 .task}

This lab will take place the week of September 29.

## Rationale {.context}

## Before you begin {.prereq}
1. Read the Pandoc Getting Started Guide at
   <http://pandoc.org/getting-started.html>.
2. Either [install](http://pandoc.org/installing.html)
   Pandoc on your laptop and confirm you can run it, or confirm that you
   can connect via ssh to the login1 linux server and execute Pandoc from
   the linux command.
3. Bring a (digital, not paper) copy of your Assignment 1 essay to
   class with you.

## Tasks {.steps}

0. Save a copy of your essay as a plain text (UTF-8 encoded) file. If
   your essay contains any illustrations, copy them into separate image
   files.

   tag the text file you just created with markdown for sections, ordered
   and unordered lists, footnotes, and any other content objects that
   exist in your essay.
2. Use Pandoc to create an HTML and a docx expression of your
   essay. Note any syntax errors or other difficulties you encounter
   in getting this to work.

- Your UTF-8 encoded essay tagged with Pandoc's markdown dialect.
- An HTML expression of your essay output from Pandoc.
