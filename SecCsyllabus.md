# Course Description
This course provides an intensive and thorough introduction to fundamentals of information organization 
and access from the point of view of the field of library and information science. The course is not an 
introduction to LIS as a whole or to the profession of librarianship--the focus is squarely on information 
organization and access. 501 aims to acquaint you with the principal problems of information organization 
and access, the main streams of thought, and the key thinkers and contributors. The material covered is 
broad in scope and applicable to a wide variety of settings and systems. The course emphasizes the 
central position of people, communities, and information users in problems of information organization and access. 

# Course Overview 
The central themes of the course are:

 1. who uses information, how they use it, and what constraints shape their use of information; 
 2. how recorded knowledge can be organized and structured;  
 3. ways of providing access to the world's knowledge.

# Learning Objectives
 1. To provide a foundation for further study in library and information science, including an appreciation for forms of systematic research in LIS.
 2. To introduce central concepts, theories, principles, research issues, and people associated with the practice and study of information organization and access.
 3. To advance a common set of ideas that help to define the profession's orientation toward problems of information organization and access.

# Course Materials
There is no required textbook for this course; required articles and book chapters are available electronically,
through the UIUC Library's electronic reserves system (<https://reserves.library.illinois.edu/ares/>), the 
UIUC Library's e-journals search tool (<http://openurl.library.uiuc.edu/sfxlcl3/az>), or the open Web (as indicated).

# Assignment 1: Information Needs/Information Seeking Behavior {#Asgt1 .task}

Due September 4 at 11:59pm. This assignment is worth 20 points.

## Rationale {.context}

The purpose of this exercise is two-fold. First, it is intended to
allow you to examine the factors that condition the information needs
or influence the information seeking behavior of a specific user
group. Second, it affords you the opportunity to explore what types of
research methods are used to do research on concrete user groups. The
handout from the first lab of class will assist you with this
exercise. Methods Handout If you'd like to know more about the
method(s) in your article, you can refer to this Research Methods
portal: <http://InformationR.net/rm/>

## Tasks {.steps}

1. Select a category of information user that interests you (e. g., high
   school student, scientist, health care consumer, migrant farm worker).
2. Identify a published research study that investigates information
   needs and/or information seeking behavior of individuals from this
   population.

## Deliverable {.result}

In a brief essay of 600-700 words (1-2 pages) discuss your article's
research question, methods, findings, and implications for design of
information systems and services (in-person, web-based, or
both). Integrate relevant readings from those assigned for class and
especially those you have read to date (and from the users and information needs
session in particular) in support of your arguments.

## Submitting {.postreq}

1. Upload your essay to the Assignment 1 Moodle dropbox.
2. Post a one-paragraph summary of your article on the Assignment 1
   discussion forum.
3. Bring a copy of your article to class for small group discussion.

## Strategies for locating research studies {.section}

Articles indexed under the subject "Information needs" or
"Information-seeking behavior" in Library & Information Science Source
(link from
<http://www.library.illinois.edu/lsx/>
<http://openurl.library.uiuc.edu/sfxlcl3/az)>

Articles indexed under the descriptor "Information seeking behaviour"
or "User needs" in LISA (link from

<http://www.library.uiuc.edu/orr/results.php?types=A&subject=29)>

Studies need not be recently published, but an example of a recent
study of this type is the following:

Darby, P.; Clough, P. (2013). Investigating the information-seeking
behaviour of genealogists and family historians.  Journal of
Information Science 39(1): 73-84.

People are increasingly investigating their family history (or
genealogy) as part of their everyday information-seeking
activities. This paper provides insight into this behaviour and
presents a new conceptual model that captures the stages of activity
carried out during people’s lifelong family history research. The
model offers a multi-phase view of the research process, intended to
illustrate: (a) the different research phases themselves; (b) the
inter-relationship between phases; (c) distinct phase-specific
behaviours; and (d) phase-specific resource preferences. Data
collected from amateur family historians by interview and
questionnaire has helped to validate the model and provide insights
into the information resources used. The findings complement existing
knowledge about family history research and will benefit: family
historians as they seek to navigate within the research process;
providers of genealogical resources as they seek to better support
users; and academics as they study information-seeking behaviours in
various contexts.

To determine whether the full text of an article is available online,
search for the journal title
at: <http://openurl.library.uiuc.edu/sfxlcl3/az>. The text of the article
may also be freely available on the web (e. g., on the author’s web
site), so you might also try doing a Google search using the article
title.  If the text is not available online, you will need to request
a copy of the article. See the LibGuide for Online and Continuing
Education Student Resources from the Library:

# Assignment 2 Digital Collections Assessment {#Asgt2 .task}

## Summary {.shortdesc}

Pick one DPLA exhibition, or one Flickr gallery or one 
Europeana pinterest board as an exemplar for your analysis.
write a narrative assessment of the content, 
organization, and potential users and uses.

Due October 2 by midnight. This assignment is worth 20 points.

## Before you begin {.prereq}

Read the required assigned readings for our collections topic before starting this assignment.
The background readings will also make your task easier.

## Rationale {.context}

The reading and discussion topic for week 5 is the nature of collections, challenges we face in making
their contents accessible, and ways in which perspectives of librarians, archivists, and information
scientists contribute to meeting those challenges. In bringing a critical, reviewer's attention to an 
existing digital collection, those issues will become more vivid and understandable to you.

## Tasks {.steps}  

 1. Pick a topic of interest to you; perhaps something related to your final project. 
 2. Browse across these three differing approaches to digital collections:
    - [DPLA exhibitions](http://dp.la/exhibitions) (28 exhibitions) 
    - [FLICKR galleries](https://www.flickr.com/photos/flickr/galleries) (there are 322) 
    - [Europeana Pinterest boards](https://www.pinterest.com/europeana/) (74 boards).
 3. For the exemplar you select, write a narrative assessment of the content, 
    organization, and potential users and uses. Include the following considerations:
    - How easy was it for you to find your exemplar? 
    - Was it hard to determine what individual or institution is responsible for your exemplar?
    - Would it be appropriate to call your exemplar a collection? If so, why? If not, why not?
    - What categories of users is your exemplar intended to serve?
    - How would you characterize the content and scope of your exemplar? 
    - Can a user easily grasp the scope and arrangement? 
    - How do the available content and organization serve the needs of the intended users? 
    - Does the exemplar meet or exceed expectations for accessibility?

## Deliverables {.result}

The essay should be a 750-800 word evaluative essay with an introduction and 
conclusion. Integrate relevant readings in support of your arguments as appropriate.
PDF, docx, and Pandoc markdown are all acceptable file formats. Pandoc 
expression requires a separate bibliography file, unless your references 
and citations are formatted at the markdown source level 
(by hand, via Zotero, etc.).

## Submitting {.postreq}
Upload the essay to the Moodle section designated for this assignment.

# Assignment 3: Topical Poster and Annotated Bibliography  {#Asgt3 .task}

## Rationale {.context}
Throughout the term, you may find a topic that piques your interest. You should explore the topic starting with resources designated as additional background readings, or as part of the resources posted by the instructor or by your classmates. You may draw from these resources and others you find on your own to build your final project.
The goal here is to learn how to use presentation software while assembling a set of core resources that allow you to pursue a 501 topic of interest to you.

Example topics:

- Information seeking strategies of homeless women
- LGBT themes in comics for high school students
- Changes in cataloging for school librarians because of RDA
- Quilt project for immigrant mothers:  Objective – preserving heritage
- Effect of open access on scientific publishing
- Data Curation: trends and themes
- Web accessibility and the University of Illinois
- Is the Dewey Decimal Classification dead to public libraries?
- Should Urbana Free Library maintain their print periodical collection?
- Frustrating search experiences for graduate students using library resources
  and some possible solutions.

## Before you begin {.prereq}

- Topics must be approved. Post a topic for instructor approval to the
  designated Moodle forum no later than September 29th.
- Create a Zotero account during our Week 3 lab session.
- Review the Purdue University resources on annotated bibliographies here:
  <https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/614/01/>
- Review our LibGuide on research poster creation here:
  <http://uiuc.libguides.com/content.php?pid=86227&sid=1404728>
- Compare research posters around our building or found online for inspiration
   on formatting and graphic layout.
- Consider the relative advantages of using different presentation
  software applications, such as Powerpoint vs. Inkscape (see resources below).

## Tasks {.steps}  

1. During the first six weeks of class, select candidate resources for your
   bibliography, enter them into Zotero, and draft preliminary annotations to
   them as attached notes.
2. Following the Purdue Writing Lab Guidelines, integrate revised annotations with
   formatted entries as a document.
3. Create the research poster as a digital file (e.g., pptx or SVG format).
4. Post an RSS link for your bibliography to the class Moodle forum.
5. Present your topic to the class at the last meeting.

## Deliverables {.result}

You have three deliverables which you will share with the class: an annotated
bibliography, a research poster (including an in-class presentation), and an RSS feed to your resources in Zotero.

Poster
: This will be formatted as if for expression on paper, but you will produce only a digital version.
  You will give us a 5 minute presentation of your poster on the last day of class.

Annotated bibliography of 20 items
: These should consist of resources that would be of interest to those wishing to
  learn more about your subject. Create descriptions, or annotations for these items
  rather than simply linking to them. Your items may be websites,
  examples of similar projects, webliographies,
  published literature, etc. Provide access to each of the to the 20 items
  (a citation, URL or by embedding the material). Use whatever citation style
  with which you are most familiar.
  Each resource should be accompanied by a paragraph advising the reader
  of the value and general content of each item.
  The annotated bibliography does **not** need to be double spaced.

RSS Feed
: Links to your feed should be posted to the Assignment 3 forum in the main lecture Moodle.  You can submit it as a reply to your initial post on your topic.


## Submitting {.postreq}
Upload the digital poster file and annotated bibliography
file to the Moodle drop box associated with this exercise.

Post your Zotero RSS feed to the main lecture forum for Assignment 3.
