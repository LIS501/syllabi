# Course Description
This course provides an intensive and thorough introduction to fundamentals of information organization 
and access from the point of view of the field of library and information science. The course is not an 
introduction to LIS as a whole or to the profession of librarianship--the focus is squarely on information 
organization and access. 501 aims to acquaint you with the principal problems of information organization 
and access, the main streams of thought, and the key thinkers and contributors. The material covered is 
broad in scope and applicable to a wide variety of settings and systems. The course emphasizes the 
central position of people, communities, and information users in problems of information organization and access. 

# Course Overview 
The central themes of the course are:

 1. Who uses information, how they use it, and what constraints shape their use of information; 
 2. How recorded knowledge can be organized and structured;  
 3. Ways of providing access to the world's knowledge.

# Learning Objectives
 1. To provide a foundation for further study in library and information science, including an appreciation for forms of systematic research in LIS.
 2. To introduce central concepts, theories, principles, research issues, and people associated with the practice and study of information organization and access.
 3. To advance a common set of ideas that help to define the profession's orientation toward problems of information organization and access.

# Course Materials
There is no required textbook for this course; required articles and book chapters are available electronically,
through the UIUC Library's electronic reserves system (<https://reserves.library.illinois.edu/ares/>), the 
UIUC Library's e-journals search tool (<http://openurl.library.uiuc.edu/sfxlcl3/az>), or the open Web (as indicated).   


The textbook *The Discipline of Organizing* by Robert J. Glushko is recommended for those new to the field.
It provides a discussion of many of the concepts we will discuss in class, and can be accessed online at
<http://vufind.carli.illinois.edu/vf-uiu/Record/uiu_7572272>.

This course will introduce you to many terms and concepts that may be new to you.

# Assignment 1 Information Needs/Information Seeking Behavior {#Asgt1 .task}

Due September due date at 11:59 PM. This assignment is worth 20 points.

## Rationale {.context}

The purpose of this exercise is two-fold. First, it is intended to
allow you to examine the factors that condition the information needs
or influence the information seeking behavior of a specific user
group. Second, it affords you the opportunity to explore what types of
research methods are used to do research on concrete user groups. The
handout from the first lab of class will assist you with this
exercise. Methods Handout If you'd like to know more about the
method(s) in your article, you can refer to this Research Methods
portal: <http://InformationR.net/rm/>

## Tasks {.steps}

1. Select a category of information user that interests you (e. g., high
   school student, scientist, health care consumer, migrant farm worker).
2. Identify a published research study that investigates information
   needs and/or information seeking behavior of individuals from this
   population.

## Deliverable {.result}

In a brief essay of 600-700 words (1-2 pages) discuss your article's
research question, methods, findings, and implications for design of
information systems and services (in-person, web-based, or
both). Integrate relevant readings from those assigned for class and
especially those you have read to date (and from the users and information needs
session in particular) in support of your arguments.

## Submitting {.postreq}

1. Upload your essay to the Assignment 1 Moodle dropbox.
2. Post a one-paragraph summary of your article on the Assignment 1
   discussion forum.
3. Bring a copy of your article to class for small group discussion.

Studies need not be recently published, but an example of a recent
study of this type is the following:

>Darby, P.; Clough, P. (2013). Investigating the information-seeking
>behaviour of genealogists and family historians.  Journal of
>Information Science 39(1): 73-84.

>People are increasingly investigating their family history (or
>genealogy) as part of their everyday information-seeking
>activities. This paper provides insight into this behaviour and
>presents a new conceptual model that captures the stages of activity
>carried out during people’s lifelong family history research. The
>model offers a multi-phase view of the research process, intended to
>illustrate: (a) the different research phases themselves; (b) the
>inter-relationship between phases; (c) distinct phase-specific
>behaviours; and (d) phase-specific resource preferences. Data
>collected from amateur family historians by interview and
>questionnaire has helped to validate the model and provide insights
>into the information resources used. The findings complement existing
>knowledge about family history research and will benefit: family
>historians as they seek to navigate within the research process;
>providers of genealogical resources as they seek to better support
>users; and academics as they study information-seeking behaviours in
>various contexts.
