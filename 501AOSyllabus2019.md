### [CATALOG DESCRIPTION]{.underline}

### Emphasizes information organization and access in settings and systems of different kinds. Traces the information transfer process from the generation of knowledge through its storage and use in both print and non-print formats. Consideration will be given to the creation of information systems: the principles and practice of selection and preservation, methods of organizing information for retrieval and display, the operation of organizations that provide information services, and the information service needs of various user communities.

### [COURSE DESCRIPTION]{.underline}

This course provides an intensive and thorough introduction to
fundamentals of information organization and access from the point of
view of the field of library and information science. The course is not
an introduction to LIS as a whole or to the profession of
librarianship\--the focus is squarely on information organization and
access. IS 501 aims to acquaint you with the principal problems of
information organization and access, the main streams of thought, and
the key thinkers and contributors. The material covered is broad in
scope and applicable to a wide variety of settings and systems. The
course emphasizes the central position of information users in problems
of information organization and access.

**[COURSE OVERVIEW]{.underline}**

The central themes of the course are:\
1) who uses information, how they use it, and what constraints shape
their use of information;\
2) how recorded knowledge can be organized and structured;\
3) ways of providing access to the world\'s knowledge.

Through lectures, readings, writing exercises, and discussion, students
will engage with concepts, theories, principles, and research on user
communities, collections, retrieval and display of information,
preservation, and general issues of access.

### [IS 501 LEARNING OBJECTIVES]{.underline}

1\. To provide a foundation for further study in library and information
science, including an appreciation for forms of systematic research in
LIS.

2\. To introduce central concepts, theories, principles, research issues,
and people associated with the practice and study of information
organization and access.

3\. To advance a common set of ideas that help to define the
profession\'s orientation toward problems of information organization
and access.

### [MS/LIS PROGRAM LEARNING OUTCOMES]{.underline}

Upon completion of the MS/LIS program, students will be able to:

-   Apply foundational concepts, theories, and principles to problems of
    information organization and access.

-   Communicate capably with diverse stakeholders, promoting not just
    access to but also effective use of information services and systems
    in specific contexts.

-   Use evidence to help address information problems, meet information
    needs, and create relationships in their institutions, communities,
    profession, and the world.

-   Compare and critique contemporary information practices, structures,
    and standards in relation to historical and global alternatives.

-   Apply core ethical principles to professional practice.

**Class Participation: 5 points total **

*Applicable learning outcome:\
* Communicate capably with diverse stakeholders, promoting not just
access to but also effective use of information services and systems in
specific contexts.

As you move into your professional lives, it will be necessary to
articulate your ideas in both written and oral form. It is important
that you think critically and present your ideas throughout the duration
of the course.

Class participation constitutes 5% of your grade. Participation includes
both involvement in weekly live sessions and postings to the Moodle
forums. Assessment of student participation will be based on the quality
of the contribution and level of student engagement, not on the quantity
of participation.

Participation can include:

-   Post questions or respond to other students' postings on forums

-   Analyze arguments in readings

-   Provide examples and counter-examples

-   Criticize readings

-   Propose alternative literature, websites or resources

-   Engage in breakout discussions and reporting out during live
    sessions

Writing

Some issues you may want to consider in your writing include:

1.  The response must show you have read the article and thought about
    it, but it should not be a mere summary of what is in the article or
    reading(s). So,

2.  Try to concentrate your writing on a focused topic. This may be a
    single article, or about a single topic that brings in several
    readings (that may include references to other material from outside
    of the class readings).

3.  Try to make an argument, that is, support your opinion (viewpoint)
    with points from the article or your experience. You may also refute
    some points from the article. Try starting the response with a
    statement about the reading(s), and then see what you can write
    about it.

4.  Why are you saying this? (For example, why is this topic or point
    important? Alternatively, how does it relate to class?)

5.  When drawing parallels or making connections, explain the nature of
    the connection. In addition to referring to the class reading(s),
    you also might cite other readings for this connection if you want.

**1. Information Needs/Information Seeking Behavior **

**January 30 (12 points) **

*Applicable learning outcome:\
* Use evidence to help address information problems, meet information
needs, and create relationships in their institutions, communities,
profession, and the world.

> Rationale\
> The purpose of this exercise is two-fold. First, it is intended to
> allow you to examine the factors that condition the information needs
> or influence the information seeking behavior of a specific user
> group. Second, it affords you the opportunity to explore what types of
> research methods are used to do research on specific user groups.
> (See: <http://guides.library.illinois.edu/c.php?g=347168&p=2342339>
> and the Sage Methods Map <http://methods.sagepub.com/methods-map>).
>
> Tasks\
> 1. Select a category of information user that interests you (e. g.,
> high school student, scientist, health care consumer, migrant farm
> worker).\
> 2. Identify a published research study that investigates information
> needs and/or information seeking behavior of individuals from this
> population. The article should be a peer-reviewed piece of academic
> research. If you are uncertain whether a given article is appropriate
> for this exercise, feel free to consult with the instructor.
>
> Deliverable\
> In a brief essay of 600-750 words discuss your article's research
> question, methods, findings, and implications for design of
> information systems and services (in-person, web-based, or both).
> Integrate relevant readings from those assigned for class in support
> of your arguments as appropriate.

> the United States.\
> *Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology*
> 70(1): 38-48.\
> Abstract\
> The process of settling in a new country can be extremely challenging,
> entailing various information needs to cope with rapid changes and
> adjustments to a new environment. Through interviews with 16 Korean
> immigrants in the United States, we explored their information
> behaviors in the settlement process. In line with prior work (Shoham &
> Strauss, 2008), we found that Korean immigrants needed various types
> of information: housing, work, banking, transportation, law, school,
> health, and language. Out of these information types, the Korean
> immigrants prioritized information for education and struggled to seek
> health and legal information. We further uncovered that various
> information needs are closely intertwined and found an additional type
> of information need: to build a new social network after migration.
> They often used Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) as
> information sources while adapting the ICT infrastructures of the U.S.
> into their information practices. ICTs enabled them to build and
> maintain *"local"* and *"global"* identity; however, they may struggle
> to assess user‐generated content in the new context. We noted that
> their strong use of ICTs for intraethnic interaction might slow down
> their integration into the host society. We discuss implications for
> future work to support immigrants\' settlement in the host country.\

Deliverable\
For the exemplar you select, please write a narrative assessment of the
content, organization, and potential users and uses. This should be in
the form of an evaluative essay with an introduction and
conclusion (750-800 words total). Integrate relevant readings in support
of your arguments as appropriate.  Include the following considerations:

-   How would you characterize the content and scope of your exemplar?

-   How would you characterize the arrangement and organization of your
    > exemplar?

-   What categories of users is your exemplar intended to serve?

-   How do the available content and organization serve the needs of the
    > intended users? 

-   Can a user easily grasp the scope and arrangement?

-   Who stewards the collection? What individuals and institutions are
    > responsible for your exemplar?

-   Are any changes in the content and organization conceivable? What
    > implications would those have for the users, and for the stewards
    > of the exemplar?

-   Do universal design or accessibility appear to have been taken into
    > consideration? How or how not? What implications are there for the
    > users, and for the stewards of the exemplar?

-   Do you consider your exemplar a collection? Justify why or why not,
    > drawing on the readings.

**3. Search and Discovery I**

**March 13 (15 points)**

*Applicable learning outcome:\
* Compare and critique contemporary information practices, structures,
and standards in relation to historical and global alternatives.

Rationale\
Users may begin their search for information on a topic with a known
item, but be interested in expanding their search to locate related
material. In a physical collection, they can do this by locating an item
on the shelf and then browsing the titles in proximity to that item to
look for other material of potential interest. In catalogs, retrieval
systems, and search engines, other approaches are needed to help the
user locate related material once the record describing the initially
sought item has been found.

> Tasks\
> In this assignment you will explore how efficient and effective
> various search tools are in leading you to material related to the
> item that is the starting point for your search. In this case you will
> be looking for two books: a (non-fiction) book by John G. Palfrey and
> Urs Gasser, *Born Digital: How children grow up in a digital age* and
> a (fiction) book by Toni Morrison, *Home.* Consult the following

**4. Indexing consistency/impact of vocabulary on access**

**April 3 (12 points)\
\
***Applicable learning outcome:*\
Apply foundational concepts, theories, and principles to problems of
information organization and access

Rationale\
The aim of this exercise is to become aware of the variations in
indexing practices and to consider the access implications for user
groups.

Tasks\
The task is to assign keywords to a journal article and then compare the
descriptors assigned for that article by professional indexing services.

The article to be used for the assignment is:  Nakata, Martin, Vicky
Nakata, Gabrielle Gardiner, Jill McKeough, Alex Byrne, and Jason Gibson.
(2008). \"Indigenous Digital Collections: An Early Look at the
Organisation and Culture Interface.\" *Australian Academic & Research
Libraries* 39, no. 4: 223-236.  \[Access the article
at <https://sfx.carli.illinois.edu/sfxuiu/az>\].   

1.  Begin by reading the paper and determining what 3 keyword terms or
    phrases you think are the most important for describing and
    providing access to that paper.

2.  *After you have assigned your own terms, *retrieve the bibliographic
    records for the paper from the following three article indexes. 
    Please note:  you'll get *much* more out of this assignment if you
    make your own choices first, without looking at those in the
    existing indexes below, so please be sure to do it in that order!\
    (1) Library & Information Science Source (LISS)\
    (2) ERIC\
    (3) Inspec\
    \[These can be located through the list of database links
    at <http://www.library.illinois.edu/infosci/>\].

3.  Identify the full subject headings, keywords, and/or descriptors
    that have been assigned to the article by each source.

> Deliverable\
> Please write a two-to-three page paper. Some students find this more
> easily accomplished in the form of a table - select the method of
> presentation that best works for you.  Integrate relevant readings in
> support of your arguments as appropriate. 

Please discuss:\
1. The differences in subject coverage among the three indexes (and your
own assigned terms).\
2. Why the sources might differ in content and scope of indexing\
3. The effectiveness of the headings for subject access by user groups
likely to search for information on this topic\
\
Submission\
Submit your assignment through Moodle.

**5. Search and Discovery II**

**April 17 (12 points)\
\
***Applicable learning outcome:*\
Compare and critique contemporary information practices, structures, and
standards in relation to historical and global alternatives.

> Rationale\
> As the number and variety of resources in digital form have increased,
> libraries have sought to assist users through new tools supporting
> federated search and resource discovery. At Illinois this currently
> takes the form of a locally developed federated search recommender
> system called Easy Search (<http://www.library.illinois.edu/>).
> Information Sciences Easy Search
> (<http://www.library.illinois.edu/infosci/>) is a more specialized
> federated search recommender system that searches the major
> Information Sciences journal and book databases and other sources
> simultaneously.
>
> Tasks\
> To learn more about how Easy Search works, read the following: Mischo,
> W. H.; Schlembach, M. C.; Bishoff, J.; German, E. M. (2012). User

> For this assignment, choose a topic covered in this course that you
> would like to learn more about.\
> 1) Try searching for it in *Information Sciences Easy Search*
> (http://www.library.illinois.edu/infosci/) both in title and as
> keywords.\
> For each search (title vs. keywords), note the term(s) you searched
> and:\
> 1) the number of items found in each of the resources searched\
> 2) which resources yielded some relevant items among the first few
> items displayed\
> 3) whether each resource yielded any unique items among the first few

**GROUP ASSIGNMENT**

**Web-based Collection Report: Genre-specific considerations **

**May 1 (20 points)**

(completed by groups of 3-4)

*Applicable learning outcomes:\
* Use evidence to help address information problems, meet information
needs, and create relationships in their institutions, communities,
profession, and the world.\
Communicate capably with diverse stakeholders, promoting not just access
to but also effective use of information services and systems in
specific contexts.\
Apply core ethical principles to professional practice.

> Your information organization has received a grant to develop a small
> collection, and your group has been put in charge of managing the
> grant. All of the items in the collection will be of a single genre or
> type of material of your choice and it is a medium that your
> organization has not handled before. As a first step, your group has
> been asked to prepare a web-based report that explores the important
> issues and approaches to dealing with this collection. You will post
> the URL of the report on the last day of class to the forum set up for
> this purpose. You will choose one or more group members to do a short
> live presentation on the project during the final class period. Other
> roles which individual members can fill include schedule
> coordination/project manager and site editing.
>
> In organizing the group to complete this project, it will probably
> work best for each member of the group to take primary responsibility
> for one of the topics. Once the individual areas of responsibility
> have been worked out, each individual investigates his/her topic and
> collaborates with the website coordinator to put together the
> webpage(s) needed to convey the desired information (e. g.,
> preservation of this type of material). The website should include a
> simple introductory page that points to the individual pages. In
> addition to hosting your website on an iSchool server, there are a
> number of other options for setting up your website, including those
> described here:
> <https://courses.ischool.illinois.edu/course/view.php?id=2743>. For

**UNGRADED ASSIGNMENT **

**February 20**

**Database Design (LibraryThing)\
\
***Applicable learning outcome:\
* Apply foundational concepts, theories, and principles to problems of
information organization and access

> For this assignment, you will create an entity-relationship diagram
> outlining a possible data model for the commercial website
> LibraryThing (<https://www.librarything.com/>). You should browse the
> LibraryThing website, identifying the major entities about which
> LibraryThing records information, the attributes for each of those
> entities, and the relationships which exist between the various
> entities. Here are some recommendations for how to familiarize
> yourself with LibraryThing and the information it records:

1.  You should first obtain a basic familiarity with LibraryThing\'s
    features and operation. Take the tour of the site
    (<https://www.librarything.com/tour/>) and look at the "About
    LibraryThing" page (<https://www.librarything.com/about>) and the
    "LibraryThing Concepts" page
    (<https://www.librarything.com/concepts>).

2.  Next, study how LibraryThing records information about bibliographic
    entities. You might want to first read the page "About Books and
    Works" at <https://www.librarything.com/about_works.php> to see how
    LibraryThing approaches the issues that FRBR tries to address. Then,
    examine the information that LibraryThing records on some individual
    items. Look at the information available for Alberto Manguel\'s *A
    History of Reading* (<https://www.librarything.com/work/2968>) and
    Tracy Chevalier's *The Lady and the Unicorn*
    (<https://www.librarything.com/work/2987>)*.* Look at **all** the
    information and the "Conversations," as well as the
    \"Recommendations\" section.

3.  In addition to traditional subject headings, LibraryThing supports
    the assignment of user defined \"tags\" to works. Look at the
    information available on user assigned tags by looking at the page
    for a particular tag (e.g,, "unicorns" at
    <https://www.librarything.com/tag/unicorns>).

4.  Next you should look at the types of information that LibraryThing
    uses to enable its various social features. You should start by
    looking at the information available regarding individual users by
    examining some user profile pages. Some librarians who inhabit
    LibraryThing include the user LAKobow
    (<https://www.librarything.com/profile/LAKobow>) and librarygeekadam
    (<https://www.librarything.com/profile/librarygeekadam>)

5.  Look over the information available on Groups at
    <https://www.librarything.com/groups_top.php> and also look at a
    particular group\'s information, such as "Librarians who
    LibraryThing"
    (<https://www.librarything.com/groups/librarianswholibrar>). Make
    sure to look at a group\'s forum.

> Based on your examination of the various forms of information
> available through LibraryThing, you will need to develop an
> entity-relationship diagram which describes the major entities present
> in LibraryThing, their respective attributes, and their relationships
> to one another. Your diagram should include three or four entities:
> (1) Work; (2) Book; and at least one other (such as Author). Each
> entity needs at least two attributes within your diagram. You will not
> submit the diagram; instead we will allow time in class to discuss
> them.
