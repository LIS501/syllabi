# Course Reading Responses {#ReadingResponse .task}


## Summary {.shortdesc}

You are responsible for writing brief two paragraph (300-400 words)
reading responses for *four* class sessions. Post to the forum set up
for the weekâ€™s discussion by 11 pm on the day following the class
meeting for that week.

Include Reading Response \#N in the subject line, so it will be clear
which of your posts is to be evaluated as a reading response.

## Before you begin {.prereq}

Read each assigned chapter or article carefully and critically. What
are the key points? What are the key assumptions? How do the themes in
the readings connect with others you have completed for this course or
others? Do you have any experiences which relate to the readings?
Stating criticisms of the readings are acceptable provided you make a
clear argument and provide examples to back it up. Suggesting other
readings or resources is perfectly acceptable, but tell us why/how you
chose these alternative sources.

## Rationale {.context}

Analysis and integration of readings, lectures, and class discussion
are enhanced by opportunities to reflect on and synthesize the ideas
presented. This assignment is designed to allow you to explore
questions that you have or connections you have made between your own
experiences, readings for this course or other coursework you have
completed. These responses will provide an opportunity to demonstrate
your ability to synthesize concepts, theories and practices covered in
this course.

## Writing {.steps}  

Some issues you may want to consider in your writing include:

1.  The response must show you have read the article and thought about
    it, but it should not be a mere summary of what is in the article
    or reading(s). So,
2.  Try to concentrate your writing on a focused topic. This may be a
    single article, or about a single topic that brings in several
    readings (that may include references to other material from outside
    of the class readings).
3.  Try to make an argument, that is, support your opinion (viewpoint)
    with points from the article or your experience. You may also refute
    some points from the article. Try starting the response with a
    statement about the reading(s), and then see what you can write
    about it.
4.  Why are you saying this? (For example, why is this topic or point
    important? Alternatively, how does it relate to class?)
5.  When drawing parallels or making connections, explain the nature of
    the connection. In addition to referring to the class reading(s),
    you also might cite other readings for this connection if you want.

## Submitting {.postreq}
Post the essay to the Moodle forum designated for this assignment.
Assessment will be based on evidence of engagement with issue(s) related
to the class topic. Each response is worth a possible 3 points.
