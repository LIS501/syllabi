# Lab 5: Cultural heritage object description {#Lab4 .task}

This lab will take place on LAB5DATE.

## Rationale {.context}

## Before you begin {.prereq}
1. Read the Spurlock Museum patron conduct policy <http://www.spurlock.illinois.edu/policy/patronconduct.html>.

2. Locate [Spurlock on the campus map](http://tinyurl.com/nsj8brt)

3. Browse the Getty A&A Thesaurus <http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/aat/>

## Tasks {.steps}

1. Convene at the Spurlock Museum at the start of class.
2. Choose a [cultural heritage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_heritage) object on display, 
   and make a note of its accession number, and the name of the gallery in which it is displayed.
3. On the basis of what you can see, and the written description accompanying the artifact, answer as many of
   the following questions as you can:
   - What physical materials is the object made from?
   - What techniques or processes were used in its creation?
   - Is the object a reproduction of some other artifact? If so, which one?
   - Does the description include precise physical measurements? If so, what are they?
   - What culture produced this object (or the original from which it was copied)?
   - During what time period was this object (or the original) created?
   - Was this object used for some particular or general purpose?
   - Is there information about the specific person who created this object or the specific time and place of creation?
   - Was the creation of the object (as opposed to the object itself) for some particular purpose?
   - If the artifact is a copy or reproduction, is the person who made the copy identified?
   - Does the object depict or represent some specific historical, mythical, or fictional person or event? If so, which?
   - Was the object contributed to the museum by an agent identified in the description? What information (if any) 
     is available about the provenance or chain of custody?
4. Reconvene in the usual classroom at GSLIS 90 minutes into the class period.
5. Lookup the record for the object you selected (by accession number) in the 
   [Spurlock online catalog](http://www.spurlock.illinois.edu/search/index.php). Compare the information in the
   record to your notes.
6. Determine whether the physical materials from which the object was made are listed in the A&A materials hierarchy.
   What are their hierarchical positions?
7. Determine whether the methods for creating the object are listed in the A&A processes and techniques hierarchy.
   What are their hierarchical positions?
8. Include the results of your thesaurus and catalog searches in a revision of your notes on the object
