Due A2DUE. This assignment is worth 20 points.

## Before you begin {.prereq}

Read the required assigned readings for our collections topic before starting this assignment.
The background readings will also make your task easier.

## Rationale {.context}

The reading and discussion topic for week 5 is the nature of collections, challenges we face in making
their contents accessible, and ways in which perspectives of librarians, archivists, and information
scientists contribute to meeting those challenges. In bringing a critical, reviewer's attention to an 
existing digital collection, those issues will become more vivid and understandable to you.

## Tasks {.steps}  

 1. Pick a topic of interest to you; perhaps something related to your final project. 
 2. Browse across these three differing approaches to digital collections:
    - [DPLA exhibitions](http://dp.la/exhibitions) (28 exhibitions) 
    - [FLICKR galleries](https://www.flickr.com/photos/flickr/galleries) (there are 322) 
    - [Europeana Pinterest boards](https://www.pinterest.com/europeana/) (74 boards).
 3. For the exemplar you select, write a narrative assessment of the content, 
    organization, and potential users and uses. Include the following considerations:
    - How easy was it for you to find your exemplar? 
    - Was it hard to determine what individual or institution is responsible for your exemplar?
    - Would it be appropriate to call your exemplar a collection? If so, why? If not, why not?
    - What categories of users is your exemplar intended to serve?
    - How would you characterize the content and scope of your exemplar? 
    - Can a user easily grasp the scope and arrangement? 
    - How do the available content and organization serve the needs of the intended users? 
    - Does the exemplar meet or exceed expectations for accessibility?

## Deliverables {.result}

The essay should be a 750-800 word evaluative essay with an introduction and 
conclusion. Integrate relevant readings in support of your arguments as appropriate.
PDF, docx, and Pandoc markdown are all acceptable file formats. Pandoc 
expression requires a separate bibliography file, unless your references 
and citations are formatted at the markdown source level 
(by hand, via Zotero, etc.).
