# Assignment 2 Collections Assessment and Comparison {#Asgt2 .task}
Due A2DUE (20 points).

## Summary {.shortdesc}

Pick two collections. Write a narrative assessment comparing the collections, including the content, organization, and potential users and uses. 

## Before you begin {.prereq}

Read the assigned readings for our collections topic before starting this assignment.

## Rationale {.context}

Issues around collections will become more vivid and understandable to you by critically assessing two exemplars.

## Tasks {.steps}  

 1. Decide which exemplar collections you will visit. Sign up for exemplar collections on the Assignment 2 wiki page.
 2. Visit both of the exemplar collections. Document your observations.
 3. Write an evaluative essay, comparing your exemplars. Include the following considerations:
    - How would you characterize the content and scope of your exemplar? 
    - How would you characterize the arrangement and organization of your exemplar? 
    - What categories of users is your exemplar intended to serve?
    - How do the available content and organization serve the needs of the intended users? 
    - Can a user easily grasp the scope and arrangement? 
    - Are any changes in the content and organization conceivable? What implications would those have, for the users, 
    and for the stewards of the exemplar?
    - Who stewards the collection? What individuals and institutions are responsible for your exemplar?
    - Do universal design or accessibility appear to have been taken into consideration? How or how not? What implications 
    or the users, and for the stewards of the exemplar?
    - Do you consider your exemplar a collection? Justify why or why not, drawing on the readings.

## Deliverables {.result}

The essay should be a 750-800 word evaluative essay with an introduction, strong arguments, a conclusion, and a bibliography. 
Integrate relevant readings in support of your arguments as appropriate.
PDF, docx, and Pandoc markdown are all acceptable file formats. Pandoc 
expression requires a separate bibliography file, unless your references 
and citations are formatted at the markdown source level 
(by hand, via Zotero, etc.).
