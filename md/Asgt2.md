# Assignment 2 Information Needs/Information Seeking Behavior {#InfoNeedsAsgt .task}

Due A2DUE (20 points).

## Rationale {.context}

The purpose of this exercise is two-fold. First, it is intended to
allow you to examine the factors that condition the information needs
or influence the information seeking behavior of a specific user
group. Second, it affords you the opportunity to explore what types of
research methods are used to do research on concrete user groups. The
handout from the first lab of class will assist you with this
exercise. Methods Handout If you'd like to know more about the
method(s) in your article, you can refer to this Research Methods
portal: <http://InformationR.net/rm/>

## Tasks {.steps}

1. Select a category of information user that interests you (e. g., high
   school student, scientist, health care consumer, migrant farm worker).
2. Identify a published research study that investigates information
   needs and/or information seeking behavior of individuals from this
   population.

## Deliverable {.result}

In a brief essay of 600-700 words (1-2 pages) discuss your article's
research question, methods, findings, and implications for design of
information systems and services (in-person, web-based, or
both). Integrate relevant readings from those assigned for class and
especially those you have read to date (and from the users and information needs
session in particular) in support of your arguments.

## Submitting {.postreq}

1. Upload your essay to the Assignment 2 Moodle dropbox.
2. Post a one-paragraph summary of your article on the Assignment 2
   discussion forum. Your forum post should have a descriptive title and please attach a copy of your article.
3. Bring a copy of your article to class on LECTUREDATE5 for small group discussion.

Studies need not be recently published, but an example of a recent
study of this type is the following:

>Darby, P.; Clough, P. (2013). Investigating the information-seeking
>behaviour of genealogists and family historians.  Journal of
>Information Science 39(1): 73-84.

>People are increasingly investigating their family history (or
>genealogy) as part of their everyday information-seeking
>activities. This paper provides insight into this behaviour and
>presents a new conceptual model that captures the stages of activity
>carried out during people’s lifelong family history research. The
>model offers a multi-phase view of the research process, intended to
>illustrate: (a) the different research phases themselves; (b) the
>inter-relationship between phases; (c) distinct phase-specific
>behaviours; and (d) phase-specific resource preferences. Data
>collected from amateur family historians by interview and
>questionnaire has helped to validate the model and provide insights
>into the information resources used. The findings complement existing
>knowledge about family history research and will benefit: family
>historians as they seek to navigate within the research process;
>providers of genealogical resources as they seek to better support
>users; and academics as they study information-seeking behaviours in
>various contexts.

To determine whether the full text of an article is available online,
search for the journal title
at: <http://openurl.library.uiuc.edu/sfxlcl3/az>. The text of the article
may also be freely available on the web (e. g., on the author’s web
site), so you might also try doing a Google search using the article
title.  If the text is not available online, you will need to request
a copy of the article. See the LibGuide for Online and Continuing
Education Student Resources from the Library:
