Assignment 2 - Information Needs/Information Behavior
=====================================================



*Rationale:*

The purpose of this exercise is two-fold. First, it is intended to allow
you to examine the factors that condition the information needs or
influence the information behavior of a specific user group. Second, it
affords you the opportunity to explore what types of research methods
are used to do research on concrete user groups. 

*Resources:*

This [Methods
Handout](https://courses.lis.illinois.edu/pluginfile.php/177070/mod_foldweek 4er/content/2/01-Research%20Methods.pdf?forcedownload=1) from
Illinois librarian Dan Tracy will assist you with this exercise. If
you\'d like to know more about the method(s) in your article, you can
refer to these Research Methods
portals: [https://web.archive.org/web/20170606053132/http://www.informationr.net/rm/](http://informationr.net/rm/).
SAGE Methods: <http://methods.sagepub.com.proxy2.library.illinois.edu>
(especially the Methods Map)

*Tasks:*


Select a category of information user that interests you (e. g., high
school student, scientist, health care consumer, migrant farm worker,
rubber duck collector).  Identify a published research study that
investigates information needs and/or information behavior of
individuals from this population. The article you select must discuss
information needs or information behavior in some clear way, if you are
unsure if the article meets this criteria, please email your instructor
to ask.

*Assignment 2A (24 hours before class): *

\(1) Before lab, on the Assignment 2
Forum **[here](https://courses.ischool.illinois.edu/mod/forum/view.php?id=305283)**,
post a one-paragraph summary of your article. Your forum post should
have a descriptive title and include a PDF your article and its
citation**.** 

(2)  Bring a copy of your article to lab class Week 4 for small group
discussions in the Research Methods Lab.

**Assignment 2B:**

In a brief essay of 3-4 pages (you shouldn\'t need more than 1,000
words) discuss your article\'s research question, methods, findings, and
implications. Support your arguments and integrate relevant
readings. You must use at least one reading as a reference in this
essay. We especially encourage you to integrate relevant readings from
those assigned for Week 4. Be sure to clearly describe your article's
research question, methods, findings, and implications. 

Strategies for locating research studies:

Articles indexed under the subject "Information needs" or "Information
behavior" in Library & Information Science Source   (link
from <https://www.library.illinois.edu/infosci/> )

Studies need not be recently published, but an example of an appropriate
study is the following:

Lee, C. P., & Trace, C. B. (2009). The role of information in a
community of hobbyist collectors. *Journal of the American Society for
Information Science and Technology*, *60*(3), 621-637.

> This article marries the study of serious leisure pursuits with
> library and information science's (LIS) interest in people's
> everyday use, need, seeking, and sharing of information. Using a
> qualitative approach, the role of information as a phenomenon was
> examined in relation to the leisure activity of hobbyist
> collecting. In the process, a model and a typology for these
> collectors were developed. We find that the information needs and
> information seeking of hobbyist collectors is best represented as an
> interrelationship between information and object needs, information
> sources, and interactions between collectors and their publics. Our
> model of the role of information in a particular domain of hobbyist
> collecting moves away from the idea of one individual seeking
> information from formal systems and shifts towards a model that
> takes seriously the social milieu of a community. This collecting
> community represents a layer of a social system with complex
> interactions and specialized information needs that vary across
> collector types. Only the serious collectors habitually engage in
> information seeking and, occasionally, in information dissemination,
> in the traditional sense, yet information flows through the
> community and serves as a critical resource for sustaining
> individual and communal collecting activities.

To determine whether the full text of an article is available online: 

Search for the journal title
at: [https://sfx.carli.illinois.edu/sfxuiu/az](http://openurl.library.uiuc.edu/sfxlcl3/az). 

The text of the article may also be freely available on the web (e. g.,
on the author's web site), so you might also try searching on Google
Scholar and other search engines using the article title, or using
[Unpaywall](http://unpaywall.org).  

If the text is not available online, check the library catalog for print
holdings. 

If Illinois doesn\'t have a copy, you will need to request a copy
through Interlibrary
loan: <https://www.library.illinois.edu/interlibrary-loan/university-of-illinois-users/>

Strategies for improving writing quality (Grammar, citations, and
syntax)

Read your draft out loud. Even better, get someone else to read it.
Purdue OWL has great writing resources, including a [citation
chart](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/using_research/citation_style_chart.html). Automatic
spelling and grammar checkers (in your wordprocessor or with tools like
[Grammarly](https://webstore.illinois.edu/shop/product.aspx?zpid=3397))
catch many basic mistakes. Plan ahead to get help from [iSchool writing
coaches](https://courses.ischool.illinois.edu/course/view.php?id=1705) and
the [campus Writers Workshop](http://www.cws.illinois.edu/workshop/).
