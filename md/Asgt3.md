Final Assignment
================

**Final Assignment: The Research Process – 40% of final grade**

The purpose of this assignment is for you to synthesize and demonstrate
your understanding of the various concepts that you have learned
throughout the course. We want you to *slow down* the
research process and reflect on the steps you actually take and the
systems you actually use. The assignment focuses less on the arguments
of the sources that you will find and more on the overall search process
for finding the sources. Think about this assignment as preparing to a
write a research paper, without ever writing the paper.

Steps:

-   Start your search diary
-   Identify an issue or topic you want to investigate
-   Search the literature and read about your topic, collecting
    citations to possible sources
-   Talk to Chris Bailey, a subject reference librarian, or a subject
    expert. DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP!
-   Choose the ten best items out of a larger pool of selected sources
-   Annotate them.
-   Prepare your presentation.
-   Write a reflection essay about your process.


There are a number of milestones along the way:

-   Wednesday February 13: Submit topic proposal (to be approved by

on this page

-   A reflection essay
-   An annotated bibliography, including the 10 best of at least 3
    different types of sources (e.g., books, encyclopedia article,
    scholarly journal article, popular press, professional journal
    article, multimedia, website, experts, etc.) 


**Deliverable details:**

Presentation

A 5-minute presentation on your Final Assignment topic and your research
process. The presentation should briefly describe your topic, how your
search process evolved and changed, and the lessons you learned along
the way. Visual aids, if any can be posted on [this
forum](https://courses.ischool.illinois.edu/mod/forum/view.php?id=305303);
they are optional for this assignment, but not required. \

*Search Diary*

The search diary is a record of your process. Date each entry and note
what you are experiencing, thinking, or doing related to the final
assignment. You can keep your diary in any format (electronic document,
online, paper, a combination, etc.). Include enough detail about the
process for you to reconstruct it later. 

You should start the search diary as soon as you begin to think about
what topic you would like to use for the final assignment. Document your
search (for instance, copy and paste from computer searches; photos or
notes from browsing and discussions). When you use information systems,
note the name of the system, the search strings, and your evaluation of
what you found. Include moments of serendipity \-- as well as
confusions, frustrations, etc. Note points of intersection with the
readings, class, discussion, etc. \-- these will help you when you write
your final assignment reflection essay.

*Reflection Essay*

You will write a reflection essay at the end of the process, drawing on
the search journal as raw material, and synthesizing what you have
learned. In your reflections, reference topics covered in the course and
readings. Interpret these based on your own experience, and illustrate
what you have learned.

*Annotated Bibliography*

Your bibliography will cover the 10 best of at least 3 different types
of sources (e.g., books, encyclopedia article, scholarly journal
article, popular press, professional journal article, multimedia,
website, experts, etc.). 

**At the top of the bibliography, indicate:**

-   The citation format you are using. We recommend one of: Chicago
    Manual of Style (either Author-Date or footnotes), APA
    6^th^ Edition, or MLA. 
-   The order in which sources are used. Any meaningful order is
    appropriate (e.g. publication date, subtopic, what you recommend
    reading first, what you found first, etc.). 

**At the top of each source, indicate:**

-   Its number in the bibliography (1-10) 
-   Its type (e.g., book, encyclopedia article, scholarly journal
    article, popular press, professional journal article, multimedia,
    website, expert, etc.). 
-   Its citation, in the format you specified

**In the body of each source, use the following headers:**

a. Summary of the source

b. Collection I found it in

c. Comments \

d. Metadata\

**Descriptions of headers. The information **

a. Summary of the source

*Short summary of the source (2-3 sentences)*


b. Collection I found it in

*Type(s) of collection (periodical, online catalog, online database,
physical collection, blog, etc.). MOST ITEMS ARE IN MULTIPLE
COLLECTIONS; BASE THIS ON HOW YOU FOUND IT. For instance, if I find a
book by browsing the shelves, \"physical collection\"; if I find it by
searching the catalog \"online catalog\".*

*Give some details about the collection, such as:*

*Who produces this collection, and for what purpose?*

*How is the collection organized?*

*How can the collection be navigated? Is there any physical organization
or any controlled vocabulary (categories, subject terms, thesaurus?)*

*What does it contain (e.g. subject coverage, date coverage)?*


c. Comments


*Make some substantive comment; try to vary these across your. Some
examples:*

*Comment on the metadata. For instance: What is informative or
misleading about this metadata? Is this the same metadata you would have
included? Why or why not? *

*Comment on the collection. Would other collections describe the item
differently? What impact does the collection have on your familiarity of
the item?*

*Comment about finding the item. At what point did you find the source
in your overall process? How did you find the source?  What search terms
and/or  strategy did you use? *


d. Metadata\


*Copy and paste metadata for online collections*

*Describe how you found it for physical collections*
