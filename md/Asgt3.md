# Assignment 3: Research Design Proposal  {#Asgt3 .task}
Materials due LAB3DATE, LAB5DATE, LAB7DATE, and LAB10DATE (40 points).
 
## Rationale {.context}

This aim of this assignment is to acquaint you with the rudiments of research design, and
invite you to think about a topic you might investigate yourself, following up on the
work in this class. This is part of your education because: 

1. Librarians, archivists, and other professionals in our discipline
   conduct and publish both academic research and institutional
   evaluation studies.

2. Understanding the aims and practices of academic and applied research
   is necessary for working in partnership with and in support of
   researchers in the communities that we serve.

3. Proposing an investigation of your own will sensitize you to design issues in published research
   that you read in this and other LIS classes.

4. According to ALA’s Core Competences of Librarianship, "A person
   graduating from an ALA-accredited master’s program in library and
   information studies should know and, where appropriate, be able to
   employ: ...
      A. The fundamentals of quantitative and qualitative research methods.
      B. The central research findings and research literature of the field.
      C. The principles and methods used to assess the actual and potential value of new research."


## Before you begin {.prereq}
- Think about any problems that interest you. How could they be formulated as research questions?
- During the first four weeks of class, review the literature related to open questions in a part of
  our discipline that interests you.
- Complete the research methods exercise during our Week 3 lab session.
- As background for Zotero, complete the LAB6DATE Zotero exercise.
- As background for the annotated bibliography, review the Purdue University resources on annotated bibliographies here: <https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/614/01/> .

## Milestone Deliverables {.steps}

1. **Research Question due LAB3DATE**, to be posted to the class discussion forum designated by your instructor
     - Pose a research question. Your post should be a sentence or two
       (no more than a paragraph). Also provide feedback and
       suggestions to your classmates by replying to their posts.

2. **Research Methods due LAB5DATE**, to be posted to the class discussion forum designated by your instructor
     - Devise methods for addressing your research question and write
       a one paragraph description of an approach that you feel would
       be appropriate for investigating the question. Draw on and
       connect this to research methods discussed in class. Post no
       more than two paragraphs (research question paragraph, revised
       from LABDATE3 + new paragraph on research methods). Also
       provide feedback and suggestions to your classmates by replying
       to their posts.

3. **Resource List due LAB7DATE**, to the class discussion forum designated by your instructor
     - Use Zotero to share 20 resources related to your research
       question and/or method. Your post should include a link to
       Zotero's RSS feed for the collection and 1-2 sentences. This
       could cover either how you found resources, types of items you
       are still looking for, or a very brief commentary about a
       resource you found interesting. Also provide feedback and
       suggestions to your classmates by replying to their posts.

## Final Deliverables  {.result}

1. **Due LAB10DATE Two page extended abstract**
     - Develop the two paragraph summary of your research question
       into a two page extended abstract. Focus on describing and
       justifying the methods for investigating your research
       question. The extended abstract is a proposal. It should
       include a statement of your research problem, a description of
       research methods for investigating the problem, and an
       explanation of what form the results of the investigation will
       take.

2. ** Due LAB10DATE Annotated bibliography of 20 items**
     - Following the Purdue Writing Lab Guidelines, create a document
       that integrates annotations with formatted entries. For each
       resource, write an annotation that situates the work presented
       with respect to your research question. Overall, the annotated
       bibliography should connect your problem to what is already
       known. It should have a meaningful order (which might be
       alphabetical, chronological, or something else). The resource
       list previously submitted may need to be modified, either
       removing or adding items as necessary to cover as many aspects
       of the problem, and the knowledge gap, as feasible. Your
       annotations should draw your reader's attention to the
       connections between the resource and your problem, and to other
       resources in the bibliography.

3. **Due LAB10DATE Five minute oral presentation**
     - Use this presentation to efficiently summarize the relevance of
       this problem to people and organizations who have a stake in
       resolving the knowledge gap that you have identified. Do
       explain the general approach to investigating the question, but
       save methodological details for the extended abstract. Five
       minute summaries are difficult, so practice your presentation
       with a classmate or colleague outside class.

### Submitting Final Deliverables{.postreq}
