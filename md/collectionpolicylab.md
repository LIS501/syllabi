Working together, author a collection policy for your collection:

- Identify which elements of policy you wish to address and develop
- Divide responsibility for authoring the policy (may wish to work in pairs, may wish to work individually)

Either post your individual contribution to the forum (with a label that  identifies which group) or compile into a single document and attach the names of all group member and have one person post to the forum with a label that identifies the collection group

- Regroup to share your contributions with each other
- Report out to the large group on the natures of your collection and on the policy development â€“ what was easy/hard/most necessary
