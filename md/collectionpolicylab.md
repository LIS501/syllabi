Working together, author a collection policy for your collection:

- Identify which elements of policy you wish to address and develop
- Divide responsibility for authoring the policy (may wish to work in pairs, may wish to work individually)

You may wish to look at some sample policies:
* Washington and Lee University Library Collection Development Policy http://library.wlu.edu/about/policies/collection-development-policy
* Georgia Public Library model policies and guidelines: http://www.georgialibraries.org/lib/collections/
* American Alliance of Museums guidelines: http://www.aam-us.org/docs/default-source/continuum/developing-a-cmp-final.pdf?sfvrsn=4

Either post your individual contribution to the forum (with a label that identifies which group) or compile into a single document and attach the names of all group member and have one person post to the forum with a label that identifies the collection group

- Regroup to share your contributions with each other
- Report out to the large group on the natures of your collection and on the policy development â€“ what was easy/hard/most necessary
