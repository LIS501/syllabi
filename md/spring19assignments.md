# Assignments and Evaluation

Assignments are due by 11:59 PM unless otherwise noted in the
assignment description. All assignments are required for all
students. Completing all assignments is not a guarantee of a passing
grade. All work must be completed in order to pass this class. Late or
incomplete assignments will not be given full credit unless the
student has contacted the instructor prior to the due date of the
assignment (or in the case of emergencies, as soon as
practicable). Late assignments will include a penalty (half a letter
grade for each day late), and no late assignments will be accepted
after 5 days from the date due.
