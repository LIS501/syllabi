# Assignments and Evaluation

Assignments are due by 11:59 PM on Thursdays meets unless otherwise
noted in the assignment description. All assignments are required for
all students. Completing all assignments is not a guarantee of a passing
grade. All work must be completed in order to pass this class. Late or
incomplete assignments will not be given full credit unless the student
has contacted the instructor prior to the due date of the assignment (or
in the case of emergencies, as soon as practicable). Late assignments
will include a penalty (half a letter grade for each day late), and no
late assignments will be accepted after 5 days from the date due. Full
assignment descriptions are available on your lab Moodle page.
