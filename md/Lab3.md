# Lab 3: Research Methods {#Lab3 .task}

## Rationale {.context}
This aim of this exercise is to give you some practice in matching research methods to the investigation
of a research question, and in thinking critically about the relative advantages and disadvantages of
the methods in different circumstances. This relates to Assignment 3A (due today) which requires that you propose a research question  you have chosen yourself, and Assignment 3B (due in 2 weeks) which requires that you to propose methods for addressing that question. In today's exercise you will consider a question assigned by your instructor, and discuss methodological alternatives with your classmates.

## Before you begin {.prereq}

1. Read the required assignments for this week on research methods. For readings that discuss and compare methods, pay
   particular attention to the authors' recommended criteria for choosing one over another. Other readings have been chosen
   for this week because the authors have chosen different methods for closely related research questions. What is it about
   a particular problem that seems to have influenced this choice? To what extent could the disciplinary background of the
   researchers have played a role in that choice?

2. Attend Tuesday's lecture on research methods at the usual time and place. What criteria do your instructors offer as a basis
   for selecting research methods? How do their criteria complement or challenge the criteria discussed in the readings?

## In Lab This Week {.steps}

1. Your instructor will divide you into small groups, and assign one
   of the questions below for you to consider.

2. Assign a facilitator as well as two recorders. One recorder will post a written summary of your
   recommendations to the forum or discussion thread designated for
   this lab. The other recorder will present a five minute oral
   summary to the class after the break.

3. Begin by making sure you understand the research question in a common way and have a sense of why you might want to ask and answer it.

4. The level of detail in the description provided to you will not be
   high enough for you to proceed without making some conjectures
   about project context. Since you're discussing an inquiry, there
   must be some knowledge gap to be investigated. But you will need to
   make reasonable assumptions about what information an investigator
   will have at the beginning of the investigation. Make a list of
   what you think is likely to be known, and what exactly needs to be
   discovered.

5. Discuss the relative advantages and disadvantages of research
   methods you learned about this week for addressing the knowledge
   gap that you've specified. Choose an approach that you think will
   be persuasive to your classmates in the other groups.



## Deliverable {.result}

Summarize your recommendation and justification in the form of an
outline. Make sure the names of all group members are included in the
file.

## Submitting {.postreq}

One member of your group should post your outline to the discussion
forum or thread designated for this lab.  One member of your group
will be responsible for delivering a five minute oral presentation of
your recommendations to the class. However all group members are
expected to contribute to answering questions from the instructor and
classmates in other groups.


## Research Questions

**Push vs. pull for consumer medical information:** The patient education
department of a hospital is trying to determine the best time for
providing newly diagnosed diabetic patients with information about
their course of disease and treatment. Some believe that providing
extensive materials immediately ensures that patients have the
information they need. Others believe that it is preferable to give
information at the point of expressed need, when patients start to ask
questions. What kind of research would help decide on the best
approach?

**Print vs. digital delivery:** A school is considering moving to online
only textbooks. Are the students ready? What kind of research would
help determine that?

**Intangible cultural heritage:** How do you know that you're making your
Grandmother's meatloaf? What processes (e.g. what skills are used in
preparation?) and attributes (e.g. how the product evaluated?) could
be checked to determine that?

**Improving a recommendation system:** A streaming video service (like
Netflix) would like to improve its recommendation system. What steps
could it take? What kind of research could be used to design
improvements? To measure their outcomes?

**Service evaluation:** The Social Security administration has created new
online services and would like to ensure that they meet the needs of
their users (mainly senior citizens who are retired or retiring, and
who receive pension money from the agency). They have asked you to
evaluate the direct deposit banking feature, which allows a person to
register and change their bank information online. What kind of
research could help determine whether the service meets the needs of a
senior citizen who wants to change his/her the bank?
