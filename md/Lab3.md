# Lab 3: Research

**Push vs. pull for consumer medical information:** The patient education
department of a hospital is trying to determine the best time for
providing newly diagnosed diabetic patients with information about
their course of disease and treatment. Some believe that providing
extensive materials immediately ensures that patients have the
information they need. Others believe that it is preferable to give
information at the point of expressed need, when patients start to ask
questions. What kind of research would help decide on the best
approach?

**Print vs. digital delivery:** A school is considering moving to online
only textbooks. Are the students ready? What kind of research would
help determine that?

**Intangible cultural heritage:** How do you know that you're making your
Grandmother's meatloaf? What processes (e.g. what skills are used in
preparation?) and attributes (e.g. how the product evaluated?) could
be checked to determine that?

**Improving a recommendation system:** A streaming video service (like
Netflix) would like to improve its recommendation system. What steps
could it take? What kind of research could be used to design
improvements? To measure their outcomes?

**Service evaluation:** The Social Security administration has created new
online services and would like to ensure that they meet the needs of
their users (mainly senior citizens who are retired or retiring, and
who receive pension money from the agency). They have asked you to
evaluate the direct deposit banking feature, which allows a person to
register and change their bank information online. What kind of
research could help determine whether the service meets the needs of a
senior citizen who wants to change his/her the bank?
