**Assignment 1 Collections Assessment and Comparison**

Due Week 2

**Summary**

Visit two collections and write a narrative assessment comparing them.
Be sure to clearly describe each collection and evaluate the collection
based on all applicable characteristics described below. Support your
arguments and write clearly. Include at least one direct reference to
the readings.

**Before you begin**

Sign up for 2 collections on the [locale sign up
wiki](https://courses.ischool.illinois.edu/mod/wiki/view.php?id=305274). Read
the assigned readings for our collections topic. Consider how to define
a collection.

**Rationale**

Issues around collections will become more vivid and understandable to
you by critically assessing two exemplars.

**Tasks**

1.  Decide which exemplar collections you will visit. 
2.  Visit both of the exemplar collections. Document your observations.
3.  Write an evaluative essay, comparing your exemplars. Include ALL of
    the following applicable considerations in your essay:

-   How would you characterize the content and scope of your exemplar?
-   How would you characterize the arrangement and organization of your
    exemplar?
-   What categories of users is your exemplar intended to serve?
-   How do the available content and organization serve the needs of the
    intended users?
-   Can a user easily grasp the scope and arrangement?
-   Are any changes in the content and organization conceivable? What
    implications would those have, for the users, and for the stewards
    of the exemplar?
-   Who stewards the collection? What individuals and institutions are
    responsible for your exemplar?
-   Do [universal
    design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_design) or [accessibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessibility)
    appear to have been taken into consideration? How or how not? What
    implications are there for the users, and for the stewards of the
    exemplar?
-   Do you consider your exemplar a collection? Justify why or why not,
    drawing on the readings.

**Deliverables**

The essay should be an evaluative essay (3-4 pages; you should not need
more than 1,000 words) with an introduction, strong arguments, a
conclusion, and a bibliography. Support your arguments and integrate
readings. Include at least one direct reference to the readings, likely
from the collections readings, with a bibliography.

**Submitting**

Submit to the Moodle Dropbox designated for this assignment.

**Resources**

The readings for our  collections  topic may be useful for this
assignment.

*Strategies for improving writing quality (Grammar, citations, and
syntax)*


Read your draft out loud. Even better, get someone else to read it.
Purdue OWL has great writing resources, including a [citation
chart](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/using_research/citation_style_chart.html). Automatic
spelling and grammar checkers (in your wordprocessor or with tools
like [Grammarly](https://webstore.illinois.edu/shop/product.aspx?zpid=3397))
catch many basic mistakes. Plan ahead to get help from [iSchool writing
coaches](https://publish.illinois.edu/ischoolwritingresources/)[ ](https://courses.ischool.illinois.edu/course/view.php?id=3389)and
the [campus Writers Workshop](http://www.cws.illinois.edu/workshop/).
