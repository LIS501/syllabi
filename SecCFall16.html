<h1 id="course-description">Course Description</h1>
<p>This course provides an intensive and thorough introduction to fundamentals of information organization and access from the point of view of the field of library and information science. The course is not an introduction to LIS as a whole or to the profession of librarianship--the focus is squarely on information organization and access. 501 aims to acquaint you with the principal problems of information organization and access, the main streams of thought, and the key thinkers and contributors. The material covered is broad in scope and applicable to a wide variety of settings and systems. The course emphasizes the central position of people, communities, and information users in problems of information organization and access.</p>
<h1 id="course-overview">Course Overview</h1>
<p>The central themes of the course are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Who uses information, how they use it, and what constraints shape their use of information;</li>
<li>How recorded knowledge can be organized and structured;</li>
<li>Ways of providing access to the world's knowledge.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="learning-objectives">Learning Objectives</h1>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>To provide a foundation for further study in library and information science, including an appreciation for forms of systematic research in LIS.</li>
<li>To introduce central concepts, theories, principles, research issues, and people associated with the practice and study of information organization and access.</li>
<li>To advance a common set of ideas that help to define the profession's orientation toward problems of information organization and access.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="course-materials">Course Materials</h1>
<p>There is no required textbook for this course; required readings are available electronically through the university library or the open Web (as indicated).</p>
<p>The textbook <em>The Discipline of Organizing</em> by Robert J. Glushko is recommended for those new to the field. It provides a discussion of many of the concepts we will discuss in class, and can be accessed online at <a href="http://vufind.carli.illinois.edu/vf-uiu/Record/uiu_7572272" class="uri">http://vufind.carli.illinois.edu/vf-uiu/Record/uiu_7572272</a>.</p>
<p>This course will introduce you to many terms and concepts that may be new to you.<br />
Remember that the Library provides access to some reference sources online that may be helpful in providing additional background and explanations.<br />

<p>Darby, P.; Clough, P. (2013). Investigating the information-seeking behaviour of genealogists and family historians. Journal of Information Science 39(1): 73-84.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>People are increasingly investigating their family history (or genealogy) as part of their everyday information-seeking activities. This paper provides insight into this behaviour and presents a new conceptual model that captures the stages of activity carried out during people’s lifelong family history research. The model offers a multi-phase view of the research process, intended to illustrate: (a) the different research phases themselves; (b) the inter-relationship between phases; (c) distinct phase-specific behaviours; and (d) phase-specific resource preferences. Data collected from amateur family historians by interview and questionnaire has helped to validate the model and provide insights into the information resources used. The findings complement existing knowledge about family history research and will benefit: family historians as they seek to navigate within the research process; providers of genealogical resources as they seek to better support users; and academics as they study information-seeking behaviours in various contexts.</p>

<p>Due September 30 (20 points).</p>
<h2 id="summary" class="shortdesc">Summary</h2>
<p>Pick one DPLA exhibition, or one Flickr gallery or one Europeana pinterest board as an exemplar for your analysis. write a narrative assessment of the content, organization, and potential users and uses.</p>
<h2 id="before-you-begin" class="prereq">Before you begin</h2>
<p>Read the required assigned readings for our collections topic before starting this assignment. The background readings will also make your task easier.</p>
<h2 id="rationale-1" class="context">Rationale</h2>
<p>The reading and discussion topic for week 6 is the nature of collections, challenges we face in making their contents accessible, and ways in which perspectives of librarians, archivists, and information scientists contribute to meeting those challenges. In bringing a critical, reviewer's attention to an existing digital collection, those issues will become more vivid and understandable to you.</p>
<h2 id="tasks-1" class="steps">Tasks</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Pick a topic of interest to you; perhaps something related to your final project.</li>
<li>Browse across these three differing approaches to digital collections:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://dp.la/exhibitions">DPLA exhibitions</a> (28 exhibitions)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/flickr/galleries">Flickr galleries</a> (there are 322)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/europeana/">Europeana Pinterest boards</a> (74 boards).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>For the exemplar you select, write a narrative assessment of the content, organization, and potential users and uses. Include the following considerations:
<ul>
<li>How easy was it for you to find your exemplar?</li>
<li>Was it hard to determine what individual or institution is responsible for your exemplar?</li>
<li>Would it be appropriate to call your exemplar a collection? If so, why? If not, why not?</li>
<li>What categories of users is your exemplar intended to serve?</li>
<li>How would you characterize the content and scope of your exemplar?</li>
<li>Can a user easily grasp the scope and arrangement?</li>
<li>How do the available content and organization serve the needs of the intended users?</li>
<li>Does the exemplar meet or exceed expectations for accessibility?</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="deliverables" class="result">Deliverables</h2>
<p>The essay should be a 750-800 word evaluative essay with an introduction and conclusion. Integrate relevant readings in support of your arguments as appropriate. PDF, docx, and Pandoc markdown are all acceptable file formats. Pandoc expression requires a separate bibliography file, unless your references and citations are formatted at the markdown source level (by hand, via Zotero, etc.).</p>

<h1 id="Asgt3" class="task">Assignment 3: Research Design Proposal</h1>
<p>Materials due September 9, September 23, October 7, and October 28 (40 points)</p>
<h2 id="rationale-2" class="context">Rationale</h2>
<p>This aim of this assignment is to acquaint you with the rudiments of research design, and invite you to think about a topic you might investigate yourself, following up on the work in this class. This is part of your education because:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Librarians, archivists, and other professionals in our discipline conduct and publish both academic research and institutional evaluation studies.</p></li>
<li><p>Understanding the aims and practices of academic and applied research is necessary for working in partnership with and in support of researchers in the communities that we serve.</p></li>
<li><p>Proposing an investigation of your own will sensitize you to design issues in published research that you read in this and other LIS classes.</p></li>
<li><p>According to ALA’s Core Competences of Librarianship, &quot;A person graduating from an ALA-accredited master’s program in library and information studies should know and, where appropriate, be able to employ: ... A. The fundamentals of quantitative and qualitative research methods. B. The central research findings and research literature of the field. C. The principles and methods used to assess the actual and potential value of new research.&quot;</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="before-you-begin-1" class="prereq">Before you begin</h2>
<ul>
<li>Think about any problems that interest you. How could they be formulated as research questions?</li>
<li>During the first four weeks of class, review the literature related to open questions in a part of our discipline that interests you.</li>
<li>Complete the research methods exercise during our Week 3 lab session.</li>
<li>As background for Zotero, complete the September 30 Zotero exercise.</li>

<li><strong>Resource List due October 7</strong>, to the class discussion forum designated by your instructor
<ul>
<li>Use Zotero to share 20 resources related to your research question and/or method. Your post should include a link to Zotero's RSS feed for the collection and 1-2 sentences. This could cover either how you found resources, types of items you are still looking for, or a very brief commentary about a resource you found interesting. Also provide feedback and suggestions to your classmates by replying to their posts.</li>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Due October 28 Two page extended abstract
<ul>
<li>Develop the two paragraph summary of your research question into a two page extended abstract. Focus on describing and justifying the methods for investigating your research question. The extended abstract is a proposal. It should include a statement of your research problem, a description of research methods for investigating the problem, and an explanation of what form the results of the investigation will take.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Due October 28 Annotated bibliography of 20 items
<ul>
<li>Following the Purdue Writing Lab Guidelines, create a document that integrates annotations with formatted entries. For each resource, write an annotation that situates the work presented with respect to your research question. Overall, the annotated bibliography should connect your problem to what is already known. It should have a meaningful order (which might be alphabetical, chronological, or something else). The resource list previously submitted may need to be modified, either removing or adding items as necessary to cover as many aspects of the problem, and the knowledge gap, as feasible. Your annotations should draw your reader's attention to the connections between the resource and your problem, and to other resources in the bibliography.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Due October 28 Five minute oral presentation
<ul>
<li>Use this presentation to efficiently summarize the relevance of this problem to people and organizations who have a stake in resolving the knowledge gap that you have identified. Do explain the general approach to investigating the question, but save methodological details for the extended abstract. Five minute summaries are difficult, so practice your presentation with a classmate or colleague outside class.</li>
