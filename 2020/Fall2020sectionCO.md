# Course Description

Emphasizes information organization and access in settings and systems
of different kinds. Traces the information transfer process from the
generation of knowledge through its storage and use in both print and
non-print formats. Consideration will be given to the creation of
information systems: the principles and practice of selection and
preservation, methods of organizing information for retrieval and
display, the operation of organizations that provide information
services, and the information service needs of various user communities.



## Pre- and Co-requisites

None.

## Student Learning Outcomes

1.  To provide a foundation for further study in library and information
    science, including an appreciation for forms of systematic research
    in LIS.
2.  To introduce central concepts, theories, principles, research
    issues, and people associated with the practice and study of
    information organization and access.
3.  To advance a common set of ideas that help to define the
    profession\'s orientation toward problems of information
    organization and access.

## Course Context

This course meets a number of learning outcomes connected to program
objectives for the M.S. in Library and Information Science program,
which in turn connect to larger iSchool and University of Illinois
learning goals.

## Course materials

There is no required textbook for this course; required readings are
available electronically through the university library or the open Web
(as indicated). This course will introduce you to many terms and
concepts that may be new to you. Remember that the Library provides
access to some reference sources online that may be helpful in providing
additional background and explanations.

# About your instructor

David Dubin is a Teaching Associate Professor at the University of
Illinois School of Information Sciences. He has over twenty five years
of teaching experience in the areas of information analysis,

# Assignments and Methods of Assessment

All work must be completed in order to pass this class. Late or
incomplete assignments will not be given full credit unless the student
has contacted the instructor prior to the due date of the assignment (or
in the case of emergencies, as soon as practicable). The weekly schedule
and required reading are posted on the course Moodle page. Any changes
will be announced in class.

### Grade distribution

  **Assignment Group**                        **Percentage of Final Grade**
  ------------------------------------------- -------------------------------

### Incomplete grades

An exceptional request for an incomplete grade is most often granted to
students encountering a medical emergency or other extraordinary
circumstances beyond their control. Students must request an incomplete
grade from the instructor. The instructor and student will agree on a
due date for completion of coursework. The student must submit an
Incomplete Form signed by the student, the instructor, and the student's
academic advisor to the front office:
<https://uofi.app.box.com/v/ISIncompleteForm>

Please see the Student Code for full details:

# Course Policies

Class attendance and participation are essential components of this
course. As such, I expect everyone to come to class on time, having read
the required material, and prepared to critically and substantially
engage with concepts and applications.

***Use of cell phones and recording devices is prohibited while class is
in session. Laptops and tablets may be used for note-taking and access
to course materials only.\
***

It is also your responsibility to ask questions regarding concepts that
you don't understand. Remember, asking questions is an excellent form of
participation. Please do not be afraid to ask questions; no question is
"dumb."

### Attendance/ Participation Policy

The iSchool expects students to attend all classes except in cases of
emergency.

Student Code on Attendance:
[[http://studentcode.illinois.edu/article1/part5/1-501/]{.underline}](http://studentcode.illinois.edu/article1/part5/1-501/)

Class discussion/participation grades are based on the quality of what
was said and how it added to the discussion, rather than the quantity of
the participation by a student. For a graduate level course, attendance
is expected, and is not counted toward the final grade.

Enrollment in this course includes expectation of regular attendance. If
you find you must miss (or have missed) class, contact the instructor as
soon as possible. Students\
may miss **one** class session with no penalty; thereafter, **each
*unexcused* *absence* will result in your grade being lowered by one
step** (for example, an A- will become a B+). Repeated tardiness or
leaving sessions early may be considered an unexcused absence unless
alternate arrangements have been made with the instructor.

Students share some of the responsibility for fostering an inclusive
classroom. Students are expected to be respectful of others\'
perspectives and lived experiences during class discussion.

# Academic Integrity

The iSchool has the responsibility for maintaining academic integrity so
as to protect the quality of education and research in our school and to
protect those who depend on our integrity. Consequences of academic
integrity infractions may be serious, ranging from a written warning to
a failing grade for the course or dismissal from the University.

See the student code for academic integrity requirements:
<http://studentcode.illinois.edu/article1/part4/1-401/>

*Please be aware that the consequences for plagiarism or other forms of
academic dishonesty will be severe. Students who violate university
standards of academic integrity are subject to disciplinary action,
including a reduced grade, failure in the course, and suspension or
dismissal from the University.*

# Statement of Inclusion

[**http://www.inclusiveillinois.illinois.edu/mission.html**](http://www.inclusiveillinois.illinois.edu/mission.html)

As the state's premier public university, the University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign's core mission is to serve the interests of the diverse
people of the state of Illinois and beyond. The institution thus values
inclusion and a pluralistic learning and research environment, one which
we respect the varied perspectives and lived experiences of a diverse
community and global workforce. We support diversity of worldviews,
histories, and cultural knowledge across a range of social groups
including race, ethnicity, gender identity, sexual orientation,
abilities, economic class, religion, and their intersections.


### Inclusiveness as a topic in IS505

The material we cover in this class frames the ways that we
understand resources, our professional roles with respect to their
stewardship, and the access and preservation problems to which our
efforts are directed. Under the right circumstances they can help make
our services more inclusive, as we\'ve seen, for example, with the
digital encoding of writing systems and attention to web content
accessibility issues. But knowledge organization systems can also
marginalize, as reforms of library subject and medical classifications
have shown. The assignment and project requirements for this course
offer flexibility for students to relate broader course objectives to
their own learning goals, interests, and current or prior professional
experience. Your instructor invites you to consider among those options
exploring issues such as:

-   The needs of underserved communities
-   Preservation of cultural heritage
-   Institutional bigotry in classification systems
-   Wealth and power distribution impacts on standards development

The readings and discussion topics for our class meetings are selected
with the aim of encouraging reflection and discussion, but those choices
are not socially or culturally neutral. Where we may be missing
opportunities to align the class content and conduct with the values
expressed in the inclusion statement, students are encouraged to call
classmate and instructor attention to those issues.

# Accessibility Statement

To obtain accessibility-related academic adjustments and/or auxiliary
aids, students with disabilities must contact the course instructor
and the [Disability Resources and Educational Services](http://disability.illinois.edu/) (DRES) as soon
as possible.  To contact DRES you may visit 1207 S. Oak St.,
Champaign, call (217) 333-4603 (V/TTY), or e-mail a message to
disability@illinois.edu.

# Land acknowledgement Statement

*Adopted by the University of Illinois in 2018 *

More information:
<https://chancellor.illinois.edu/land_acknowledgement.html>

As a land-grant institution, the University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign has a responsibility to acknowledge the historical
context in which it exists. In order to remind ourselves and our
community, we will begin this event with the following statement. We are
currently on the lands of the Peoria, Kaskaskia, Peankashaw, Wea, Miami,
Mascoutin, Odawa, Sauk, Mesquaki, Kickapoo, Potawatomi, Ojibwe, and
Chickasaw Nations. It is necessary for us to acknowledge these Native
Nations and for us to work with them as we move forward as an
institution. Over the next 150 years, we will be a vibrant community
inclusive of all our differences, with Native peoples at the core of our
efforts.

Land Acknowledgement Statement Suggested by Native American House:\
I/We would like to begin today by recognizing and acknowledging that we
are on the lands of the Peoria, Kaskaskia, Piankashaw, Wea, Miami,
Mascoutin, Odawa, Sauk, Mesquaki, Kickapoo, Potawatomi, Ojibwe, and
Chickasaw Nations. These lands were the traditional territory of these
Native Nations prior to their forced removal; these lands continue to
carry the stories of these Nations and their struggles for survival and
identity.\

As a land-grant institution, the University of Illinois has a particular
responsibility to acknowledge the peoples of these lands, as well as the
histories of dispossession that have allowed for the growth of this
institution for the past 150 years. We are also obligated to reflect on
and actively address these histories and the role that this university
has played in shaping them. This acknowledgement and the centering of
Native peoples is a start as we move forward for the next 150 years.
