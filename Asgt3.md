# Assignment 3: Topical Poster and Annotated Bibliography  {#Asgt3 .task}

Preliminary topic: February 5th <https://courses.lis.illinois.edu/mod/forum/view.php?id=208062>

Zotero collection (annotated bibliography) of research sources: March 12

Presentation: March 12

## Rationale {.context}
Throughout the term, you may find a topic that piques your interest. You will 
find many resources posted in the background readings area – and as part of 
the resources posted by the instructor or by your classmates. You may draw 
heavily from these resources as you build your final project. The goal here is 
to learn how to use (or expand your skills) LibGuide software, while assembling
a set of core resources that allow you to pursue a 501 topic of interest to you.

Presentations will occur during the last session of class, March 12 in Room 242.

The instructor must approve your topic. Please post it on the forum here by 
February 5th This is your first opportunity to discuss your initial thoughts about
your topic with the instructor and your classmates. There will be at least one other
opportunity during the term for us to check in about this project.  Presentations 
will be March 12.

Example topics:

- Information seeking strategies of homeless women
- LGBT themes in comics for high school students
- Changes in cataloging for school librarians because of RDA
- Quilt project for immigrant mothers:  Objective – preserving heritage
- Effect of open access on scientific publishing
- Data Curation: trends and themes
- Web accessibility and the University of Illinois
- Is the Dewey Decimal Classification dead to public libraries?
- Should Urbana Free Library maintain their print periodical collection?
- Frustrating search experiences for graduate students using library resources 
  and some possible solutions.

## Deliverables {.result}

You have two deliverables which you will share with the class by posting the 
link to your zotero collection and by uploading your digital poster (or a link
to it) here: <https://courses.lis.illinois.edu/mod/forum/view.php?id=209232>

Poster
: You will give us a 10 minute presentation of your poster on the last day of class. 
[I'd prepare for an approximately 7 minute presentation and leave the rest of the 
time for questions.) See Resources below to find out more about Digital posters 
and see examples of posters 

Annotated bibliography) of 20 items
: These should consist of resources that would be of interest to those wishing to 
learn more about your subject. Create descriptions, or annotations for these items
rather than simply linking to them. More about annotations: 
<https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/614/01/>(see also Guidelines for 
annotated bibliography). You will be setting up a Zotero account for this project 
in lab on February 12.
: Your items may be websites, examples of similar projects, webliographies, 
  published literature, etc. Provide access to each of the to the 20 items 
  (a citation, URL or by embedding the material). Use whatever citation style
  with which you are most familiar.
  Each resource should be accompanied by 2-3 sentences that advise the reader
  of the value and general content of each item.
