# Assignment 3: Topical Poster and Annotated Bibliography  {#Asgt3 .task}

## Rationale {.context}
Throughout the term, you may find a topic that piques your interest. You should explore the topic starting with resources designated as additional background readings, or as part of the resources posted by the instructor or by your classmates. You may draw from these resources and others you find on your own to build your final project.
The goal here is to learn how to use presentation software while assembling a set of core resources that allow you to pursue a 501 topic of interest to you.

Example topics:

- Information seeking strategies of homeless women
- LGBT themes in comics for high school students
- Changes in cataloging for school librarians because of RDA
- Quilt project for immigrant mothers:  Objective â€“ preserving heritage
- Effect of open access on scientific publishing
- Data Curation: trends and themes
- Web accessibility and the University of Illinois
- Is the Dewey Decimal Classification dead to public libraries?
- Should Urbana Free Library maintain their print periodical collection?
- Frustrating search experiences for graduate students using library resources
  and some possible solutions.

## Before you begin {.prereq}

- Topics must be approved. Post a topic for instructor approval to the
  designated Moodle forum no later than September 29th.
- Create a Zotero account during our Week 3 lab session.
- Review the Purdue University resources on annotated bibliographies here:
  <https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/614/01/>
- Review our LibGuide on research poster creation here:
  <http://uiuc.libguides.com/content.php?pid=86227&sid=1404728>
- Compare research posters around our building or found online for inspiration
   on formatting and graphic layout.
- Consider the relative advantages of using different presentation
  software applications, such as Powerpoint vs. Inkscape (see resources below).

## Tasks {.steps}  

1. During the first six weeks of class, select candidate resources for your
   bibliography, enter them into Zotero, and draft preliminary annotations to
   them as attached notes.
2. Following the Purdue Writing Lab Guidelines, integrate revised annotations with
   formatted entries as a document.
3. Create the research poster as a digital file (e.g., pptx or SVG format).
4. Post an RSS link for your bibliography to the class Moodle forum.
5. Present your topic to the class at the last meeting.

## Deliverables {.result}

You have three deliverables which you will share with the class: an annotated
bibliography, a research poster (including an in-class presentation), and an RSS feed to your resources in Zotero.

Poster
: This will be formatted as if for expression on paper, but you will produce only a digital version.
  You will give us a 5 minute presentation of your poster on the last day of class.

Annotated bibliography of 20 items
: These should consist of resources that would be of interest to those wishing to
  learn more about your subject. Create descriptions, or annotations for these items
  rather than simply linking to them. Your items may be websites,
  examples of similar projects, webliographies,
  published literature, etc. Provide access to each of the to the 20 items
  (a citation, URL or by embedding the material). Use whatever citation style
  with which you are most familiar.
  Each resource should be accompanied by a paragraph advising the reader
  of the value and general content of each item.

The annotated bibliography does NOT need to be double spaced.

RSS Feed

:Links to your feed should be posted to the Assignment 3 forum in the main lecture Moodle.  You can submit it as a reply to your initial post on your topic.


## Submitting {.postreq}
Upload the digital poster file and annotated bibliography
file to the Moodle drop box associated with this exercise.

Post your Zotero RSS feed to the main lecture forum for Assignment 3.
