# Course Description

The course description paragraph from the course catalog goes here.

This course provides an intensive and thorough introduction to
fundamentals of information organization and access from the point of
view of the field of library and information science. The course is
not an introduction to LIS as a whole or to the profession of
librarianship--the focus is squarely on information organization and
access. 501 aims to acquaint you with the principal problems of
information organization and access, the main streams of thought, and
the key thinkers and contributors. The material covered is broad in
scope and applicable to a wide variety of settings and systems. The
course emphasizes the central position of people, communities, and
information users in problems of information organization and access.
