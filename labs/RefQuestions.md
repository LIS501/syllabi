# Questions for the reference interview exercise

1. I seem to remember an old Danny Kaye movie in which he plays a
   bizarre chess-like game wherein practically every move must be
   followed by some verbal declaration (like how in chess, you say,
   "check"). Of course, he has no idea how to play, and the rules make
   no sense, so as he's taking his turn he happens to look aside and
   sees an attractive woman adjusting her clothing, and he says,
   "Yipe!" which turns out to be a winning move in the game. Does
   anyone remember this?  What movie is it from? (used with Phil
   Fleischmann's permission).

2. I've often heard that the atoms making up our bodies are completely
   different after some number of years. Is that really true? I'm
   skeptical, and I'd like a high-level scientific explanation that's
   understandable to a lay person. But at the same time I want
   examples of reputable scholarship that backs up either the claim or
   its refutation.

3. It's said that Queen Cleopatra was the first in her family dynasty
   to speak the Egyptian language. How confident are we that this
   claim is either true or false? Can it be traced to specific named
   individuals who would have been present to hear her speak the
   language? Do we know of any specific Egyptian phrase or sentence
   that Cleopatra is supposed to have spoken or written? What kind of
   evidence do we have about the languages spoken in her court?

4. A classmate told me that some iSchool professor is supposed to have
   performed live at the Woodstock festival in 1969, and also appeared
   in a psychedelic western movie. I want to know who it was, and I
   really want photographic evidence from the movie and the concert.
