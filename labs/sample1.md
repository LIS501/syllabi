# This is a top level heading!

This is the start of a paragraph. This sentence includes some *emphasized text.* This sentence has
some **strongly emphasized** text.

Adding a blank line starts a new paragraph.  Don't worry about indenting new paragraphs or putting extra spaces
after a sentence. There are a few things you should know about lists:

- There are several kinds of lists, including itemized and enumerated.
- In markdown, enumerated lists are tagged using hyphens.

    1. With consistent indenting, you can next one list inside of another
    2. Make sure you use the same number and type of white space characters for indenting

- A blank line will end the list.
