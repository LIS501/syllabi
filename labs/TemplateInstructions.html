<p>The accompanying markdown file expresses a cultural heritage object description. You can add or modify the structure to suit the needs of the object you have selected. For example, you are free to add additional descriptive fields, or omit fields that aren't relevant. We recommend that your description conform to the following general structure:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>A YAML metadata block at the top of the file specifying title, author, and date of the description. This is documented in the Pandoc User Manual in the section titled <a href="http://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#metadata-blocks">Metadata Blocks</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>A level 1 header presenting the name of the artifact.</p></li>
<li><p>A <strong>Summary</strong> section, marked with a level 2 header, and containing one paragraph of general description in natural language.</p></li>
<li><p>A <strong>Basic Identification</strong> section, marked with a level 2 header, and consisting of attribute/value pairings expressed as a <a href="http://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#definition-lists">definition list</a>. This section should include materials, physical description, and methods of creation, if they are known. As described in the documentation and demonstrated in the accompanying file, definition list entries can more than one definition, so attributes with multiple values (such as materials or dimensions) can be grouped together.</p></li>
<li><p>A <strong>Provenance</strong> section, marked with a level 2 header, and consisting of attribute/value pairings expressed as a <a href="http://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#definition-lists">definition list</a>. This section should include attributes connected to the origin, background and custody of the artifact.</p></li>
<li><p>A <strong>Notes</strong> section, marked with a level 2 header, and containing any additional information that does not seem to fit in with the other sections.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="remarks">Remarks</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Hyperlinks to additonal sources can be tagged using the <a href="http://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#inline-links">markdown inline link syntax</a>, but are optional.</p></li>
<li><p>You are encouraged to include descriptor IDs from the <a href="http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/aat/">Getty Arts and Architecture Thesaurus</a> (AAT) for materials and processes, and from the <a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/tgn/">Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names</a> (TGN) for geographic regions. Be sure to read the scope notes in the AAT entries before using them. In the example I've prepared for you, the Spurlock Museum refers to the method of manufacture as &quot;Electrotyping.&quot; But that word has a different meaning in AAT, and the correct AAT descriptor for this method is &quot;Electroforming.&quot;</p></li>
