# Pandoc in Lab
Our plan for lab is:
1. Install pandoc.
2. Get ready to use pandoc. 
3. Test that pandoc is working
4. Try using pandoc at the command line as a filter (see http://pandoc.org/getting-started.html#step-4-using-pandoc-as-a-filter ) 
5. Transform your cultural heritage object description into two versions (e.g. HTML and DOCX), with pandoc. 
6. Markup a recipe in markdown and post it to the forum.
7. Download several recipes from the forum. Use pandoc to make an EPUB cookbook.

Don't worry if you 

## First install Pandoc

1.  Download the right installer for your operating system. (Pick
    the [installer for Mac OS
    X](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases/download/1.19.2.1/pandoc-1.19.2.1-osx.pkg), [installer
    for
    Windows](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases/download/1.19.2.1/pandoc-1.19.2.1-windows.msi),
    or [installer for Debian/
    Ubuntu](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases/download/1.19.2.1/pandoc-1.19.2.1-1-amd64.deb).)
2.  Double-click the downloaded file.
3.  Follow menu prompts.

## Get ready to use Pandoc
1.  Do you know how to get to your shell? ("[command line
    interface](https://www.ictlounge.com/html/operating_systems.htm)")
2. Later you will need to know how to do certain things with your shell. Some useful sites:
[Windows](https://www.lifewire.com/list-of-windows-7-command-prompt-commands-4107370)
[Mac](https://ss64.com/osx/)
    
## Test that pandoc is working
1.  Open your shell (Terminal, Windows Command Prompt, etc.)
2.  At the command line, type the following:
    1.  `pandoc --version`
    2.  Then hit the 'Enter' key

If the message you get shows an error, ask one of the instructors. If you're doing this outside of class, post to this week's forum. For best results, copy and paste what you entered and what happened, and/or
share a screenshot

1. Follow the instructions at <http://pandoc.org/getting-started.html#step-4-using-pandoc-as-a-filter>

## Transform your cultural heritage object description into two versions (e.g. HTML and DOCX), with pandoc. 
1.  Linked is an input file, [sample1.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LIS501/syllabi/master/labs/sample1.md)
2.  Can you figure out how to get HTML or a DOCX file from this input
    file with Pandoc?
3.  Hint: We used steps 1-4 of the "getting started" guide already:
    <http://pandoc.org/getting-started.html> What about the rest of the
    guide?
