# Pandoc in Labs 4 and 5

As I mentioned in class, please install [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org) this
week, and test that it works, so that you're ready to use Pandoc for
Labs 4 and 5.

## First install Pandoc

1.  Download the right installer for your operating system. (Pick
    the [installer for Mac OS
    X](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases/download/1.17.2/pandoc-1.17.2-osx.pkg), [installer
    for
    Windows](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases/download/1.17.2/pandoc-1.17.2-windows.msi),
    or [installer for Debian/
    Ubuntu](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases/download/1.17.2/pandoc-1.17.2-1-amd64.deb).)
2.  Double-click the downloaded file.
3.  Follow menu prompts.

## Then test that Pandoc is working

1.  Close and reopen your shell (Terminal, Windows Command Prompt, etc.)
    if needed
2.  At the command line, type the following:
    1.  `pandoc --version`
    2.  Then hit the 'Enter' key

If the message you get shows an error, post to the Access forum. For
best results, copy and paste what you entered and what happened, and/or
share a screenshot

## Getting ready to use Pandoc

1.  Do you know how to get to your shell? ("[command line
    interface](https://courses.ischool.illinois.edu/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=354946)")
2.  Do you know how to get to your text editor?
3.  Linked is an input file, [sample1.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LIS501/syllabi/master/labs/sample1.md)
4.  Can you figure out how to get HTML or a DOCX file from this input
    file with Pandoc?
5.  Hint: We used steps 1 & 2 of the "getting started" guide already:
    <http://pandoc.org/getting-started.html> What about the rest of the
    guide?

Let us know if you have any problems installing Pandoc, or if something
just doesn't work the way you expect. The Access forum is a great place
to do that -- and you can also come talk with us during office hours.
