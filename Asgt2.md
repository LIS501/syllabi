 DELIVERABLE:

For the exemplar you select, please write a narrative assessment of the content, 
organization, and potential users and uses. This should be in the form of an 
evaluative essay with an introduction and conclusion (750-800 words total). 
Integrate relevant readings in support of your arguments as appropriate.
Include the following considerations:

 How easy was it for you to find your exemplar? Was it hard to determine what individual or 
 institution is responsible for your exemplar?
 
 Would it be appropriate to call your exemplar a collection? If so, why? If not, why not?
 
 What categories of users is your exemplar intended to serve?
    
 How would you characterize the content and scope of your exemplar? 
 
 Can a user easily grasp the scope and arrangement?
    
 How do the available content and organization serve the needs of the intended users? 
 
 Does the exemplar meet or exceed expectations for accessibility?
