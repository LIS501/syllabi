organization, and potential users and uses.   

Include the following considerations:

 - How easy was it for you to find your exemplar? 
 - Was it hard to determine what individual or institution is responsible for your exemplar?
 - Would it be appropriate to call your exemplar a collection? If so, why? If not, why not?
 - What categories of users is your exemplar intended to serve?
 - How would you characterize the content and scope of your exemplar? 
 - Can a user easily grasp the scope and arrangement? 
 - How do the available content and organization serve the needs of the intended users? 
 - Does the exemplar meet or exceed expectations for accessibility?
