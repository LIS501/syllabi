# Course Description
This course provides an intensive and thorough introduction to fundamentals of information organization 
and access from the point of view of the field of library and information science. The course is not an 
introduction to LIS as a whole or to the profession of librarianship--the focus is squarely on information 
organization and access. 501 aims to acquaint you with the principal problems of information organization 
and access, the main streams of thought, and the key thinkers and contributors. The material covered is 
broad in scope and applicable to a wide variety of settings and systems. The course emphasizes the 
central position of people, communities, and information users in problems of information organization and access. 

# Course Overview 
The central themes of the course are:

1. Who uses information, how they use it, and what constraints shape their use of information; 
2. How recorded knowledge can be organized and structured;
3. Ways of providing access to the world's knowledge.

# Learning Objectives

1. To provide a foundation for further study in library and information science, including an appreciation for forms of systematic research in LIS.
2. To introduce central concepts, theories, principles, research issues, and people associated with the practice and study of information organization and access.
3. To advance a common set of ideas that help to define the profession's orientation toward problems of information organization and access.

# Course Materials
There is no required textbook for this course; required readings are available electronically through the university library or the open Web (as indicated).   

The textbook *The Discipline of Organizing* by Robert J. Glushko is recommended for those new to the field.
It provides a discussion of many of the concepts we will discuss in class, and can be accessed online at
<http://vufind.carli.illinois.edu/vf-uiu/Record/uiu_7572272>.

This course will introduce you to many terms and concepts that may be new to you.  
Remember that the Library provides access to some reference sources online that may be helpful in providing additional 
background and explanations.

# Academic Integrity
Please review and reflect on the academic integrity policy of the University of Illinois,
<http://admin.illinois.edu/policy/code/article1_part4_1-401.html> to which we subscribe.
By turning in materials for review, you certify that all work presented is your own and
has been done by you independently, or as a member of a designated group for group assignments.
If, in the course of your writing, you use the words or ideas of another writer, proper
acknowledgement must be given (using APA, Chicago, or MLA style). Not to do so is to commit
plagiarism, a form of academic dishonesty. If you are not absolutely clear on what constitutes
plagiarism and how to cite sources appropriately, now is the time to learn. Please ask me!
Please be aware that the consequences for plagiarism or other forms of academic dishonesty
will be severe. Students who violate university standards of academic integrity are
subject to disciplinary action, including a reduced grade, failure in the course, and
suspension or dismissal from the University.

# Assignment 1 Information Needs/Information Seeking Behavior {#Asgt1 .task}

Due September 1 (20 points).

## Rationale {.context}

The purpose of this exercise is two-fold. First, it is intended to
allow you to examine the factors that condition the information needs
or influence the information seeking behavior of a specific user
group. Second, it affords you the opportunity to explore what types of
research methods are used to do research on concrete user groups. The
handout from the first lab of class will assist you with this
exercise. Methods Handout If you'd like to know more about the
method(s) in your article, you can refer to this Research Methods
portal: <http://InformationR.net/rm/>

## Tasks {.steps}

1. Select a category of information user that interests you (e. g., high
   school student, scientist, health care consumer, migrant farm worker).
2. Identify a published research study that investigates information
   needs and/or information seeking behavior of individuals from this
   population.

## Deliverable {.result}

In a brief essay of 600-700 words (1-2 pages) discuss your article's
research question, methods, findings, and implications for design of
information systems and services (in-person, web-based, or
both). Integrate relevant readings from those assigned for class and
especially those you have read to date (and from the users and information needs
session in particular) in support of your arguments.

## Submitting {.postreq}

1. Upload your essay to the Assignment 1 Moodle dropbox.
2. Post a one-paragraph summary of your article on the Assignment 1
   discussion forum. Your forum post should have a descriptive title and please attach a copy of your article.
3. Bring a copy of your article to class on LABDATE3 for small group discussion.

## Strategies for locating research studies {.section}

Articles indexed under the subject "Information needs" or
"Information-seeking behavior" in Library & Information Science Source:

- <http://www.library.illinois.edu/lsx/>
- <http://openurl.library.uiuc.edu/sfxlcl3/az>

Articles indexed under the descriptor "Information seeking behavior"
or "User needs" in LISA:

- <http://www.library.illinois.edu/lsx/>
- <http://openurl.library.uiuc.edu/sfxlcl3/az>
- <http://www.library.uiuc.edu/orr/results.php?types=A&subject=29>

Studies need not be recently published, but an example of a recent
study of this type is the following:

>Darby, P.; Clough, P. (2013). Investigating the information-seeking
>behaviour of genealogists and family historians.  Journal of
>Information Science 39(1): 73-84.

>People are increasingly investigating their family history (or
>genealogy) as part of their everyday information-seeking
>activities. This paper provides insight into this behaviour and
>presents a new conceptual model that captures the stages of activity
>carried out during people’s lifelong family history research. The
>model offers a multi-phase view of the research process, intended to
>illustrate: (a) the different research phases themselves; (b) the
>inter-relationship between phases; (c) distinct phase-specific
>behaviours; and (d) phase-specific resource preferences. Data
>collected from amateur family historians by interview and
>questionnaire has helped to validate the model and provide insights
>into the information resources used. The findings complement existing
>knowledge about family history research and will benefit: family
>historians as they seek to navigate within the research process;
>providers of genealogical resources as they seek to better support
>users; and academics as they study information-seeking behaviours in
>various contexts.

To determine whether the full text of an article is available online,
search for the journal title
at: <http://openurl.library.uiuc.edu/sfxlcl3/az>. The text of the article
may also be freely available on the web (e. g., on the author’s web
site), so you might also try doing a Google search using the article
title.  If the text is not available online, you will need to request
a copy of the article. See the LibGuide for Online and Continuing
Education Student Resources from the Library:

- <http://uiuc.libguides.com/content.php?pid=28713&sid=209698>
- <http://uiuc.libguides.com/content.php?pid=28713&sid=214766>

# Assignment 2 Digital Collections Assessment {#Asgt2 .task}
Due September 29 (20 points).

## Summary {.shortdesc}

Pick one DPLA exhibition, or one Flickr gallery or one 
Europeana pinterest board as an exemplar for your analysis.
write a narrative assessment of the content, 
organization, and potential users and uses.

## Before you begin {.prereq}

Read the required assigned readings for our collections topic before starting this assignment.
The background readings will also make your task easier.

## Rationale {.context}

The reading and discussion topic for week 6 is the nature of collections, challenges we face in making
their contents accessible, and ways in which perspectives of librarians, archivists, and information
scientists contribute to meeting those challenges. In bringing a critical, reviewer's attention to an 
existing digital collection, those issues will become more vivid and understandable to you.

## Tasks {.steps}  

 1. Pick a topic of interest to you; perhaps something related to your final project. 
 2. Browse across these three differing approaches to digital collections:
    - [DPLA exhibitions](http://dp.la/exhibitions) (28 exhibitions) 
    - [Flickr galleries](https://www.flickr.com/photos/flickr/galleries) (there are 322) 
    - [Europeana Pinterest boards](https://www.pinterest.com/europeana/) (74 boards).
 3. For the exemplar you select, write a narrative assessment of the content, 
    organization, and potential users and uses. Include the following considerations:
    - How easy was it for you to find your exemplar? 
    - Was it hard to determine what individual or institution is responsible for your exemplar?
    - Would it be appropriate to call your exemplar a collection? If so, why? If not, why not?
    - What categories of users is your exemplar intended to serve?
    - How would you characterize the content and scope of your exemplar? 
    - Can a user easily grasp the scope and arrangement? 
    - How do the available content and organization serve the needs of the intended users? 
    - Does the exemplar meet or exceed expectations for accessibility?

## Deliverables {.result}

The essay should be a 750-800 word evaluative essay with an introduction and 
conclusion. Integrate relevant readings in support of your arguments as appropriate.
PDF, docx, and Pandoc markdown are all acceptable file formats. Pandoc 
expression requires a separate bibliography file, unless your references 
and citations are formatted at the markdown source level 
(by hand, via Zotero, etc.).

## Submitting {.postreq}
Upload the essay to the Moodle drop box designated for this assignment.

# Assignment 3: Research Design Proposal  {#Asgt3 .task}
Materials due September 8, September 22, October 6, and October 27 (40 points).
 
## Rationale {.context}

This aim of this assignment is to acquaint you with the rudiments of research design, and
invite you to think about a topic you might investigate yourself, following up on the
work in this class. This is part of your education because: 

1. Librarians, archivists, and other professionals in our discipline
   conduct and publish both academic research and institutional
   evaluation studies.

2. Understanding the aims and practices of academic and applied research
   is necessary for working in partnership with and in support of
   researchers in the communities that we serve.

3. Proposing an investigation of your own will sensitize you to design issues in published research
   that you read in this and other LIS classes.

4. According to ALA’s Core Competences of Librarianship, "A person
   graduating from an ALA-accredited master’s program in library and
   information studies should know and, where appropriate, be able to
   employ: ...
      A. The fundamentals of quantitative and qualitative research methods.
      B. The central research findings and research literature of the field.
      C. The principles and methods used to assess the actual and potential value of new research."


## Before you begin {.prereq}
- Think about any problems that interest you. How could they be formulated as research questions?
- During the first four weeks of class, review the literature related to open questions in a part of
  our discipline that interests you.
- Complete the research methods exercise during our Week 3 lab session.
- As background for Zotero, complete the September 29 Zotero exercise.
- As background for the annotated bibliography, review the Purdue University resources on annotated bibliographies here: <https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/614/01/> .

## Milestone Deliverables {.steps}

1. **Research Question due September 8**, to be posted to the *Assignment 3A: Research Question* forum
     - Pose a research question. Your post should be a sentence or two
       (no more than a paragraph). Also provide feedback and
       suggestions to your classmates by replying to their posts.

2. **Research Methods due September 22**, to be posted to the *Assignment 3B: Research Methods* forum
     - Post no more than two paragraphs (the first paragraph is revised from Assignment 3A; the second paragraph is on research methods). In the new paragraph, devise methods for addressing your research question and write a one paragraph description of an approach that you feel would be appropriate for investigating the question. Draw on and connect this to research methods discussed in class. Also provide feedback and suggestions to your classmates by replying to their posts.

3. **Resource List due October 6**, to the *Assignment 3C: Resource List* forum
     - Use Zotero to share 20 resources related to your research
       question and/or method. Your post should include a link to
       Zotero's RSS feed for the collection and 1-2 sentences. This
       could cover either how you found resources, types of items you
       are still looking for, or a very brief commentary about a
       resource you found interesting. Also provide feedback and
       suggestions to your classmates by replying to their posts.

## Final Deliverables  {.result}


1. **Due October 27 Two page extended abstract**, to the Moodle drop box *Assignment 3 abstract & bibliography* 
     - Develop the two paragraph summary of your research question
       into a two page extended abstract. Focus on describing and
       justifying the methods for investigating your research
       question. The extended abstract is a proposal. It should
       include a statement of your research problem, a description of
       research methods for investigating the problem, and an
       explanation of what form the results of the investigation will
       take.

2. **Due October 27 Annotated bibliography of 20 items**, to the Moodle drop box *Assignment 3 abstract & bibliography* 
     - Following the Purdue Writing Lab Guidelines, create a document
       that integrates annotations with formatted entries. For each
       resource, write an annotation that situates the work presented
       with respect to your research question. Overall, the annotated
       bibliography should connect your problem to what is already
       known. It should have a meaningful order (which might be
       alphabetical, chronological, or something else). The resource
       list previously submitted may need to be modified, either
       removing or adding items as necessary to cover as many aspects
       of the problem, and the knowledge gap, as feasible. Your
       annotations should draw your reader's attention to the
       connections between the resource and your problem, and to other
       resources in the bibliography.

3. **Due October 27 Five minute oral presentation, during the last class meeting**
     - Use this presentation to efficiently summarize the relevance of
       this problem to people and organizations who have a stake in
       resolving the knowledge gap that you have identified. Do
       explain the general approach to investigating the question, but
       save methodological details for the extended abstract. Five
       minute summaries are difficult, so practice your presentation
       with a classmate or colleague outside class.
