# Course Description
This course provides an intensive and thorough introduction to fundamentals of information organization 
and access from the point of view of the field of library and information science. The course is not an 
introduction to LIS as a whole or to the profession of librarianship--the focus is squarely on information 
organization and access. 501 aims to acquaint you with the principal problems of information organization 
and access, the main streams of thought, and the key thinkers and contributors. The material covered is 
broad in scope and applicable to a wide variety of settings and systems. The course emphasizes the 
central position of people, communities, and information users in problems of information organization and access. 

# Course Overview 
The central themes of the course are:

 1. Who uses information, how they use it, and what constraints shape their use of information; 
 2. How recorded knowledge can be organized and structured;  
 3. Ways of providing access to the world's knowledge.

# Learning Objectives
 1. To provide a foundation for further study in library and information science, including an appreciation for forms of systematic research in LIS.
 2. To introduce central concepts, theories, principles, research issues, and people associated with the practice and study of information organization and access.
 3. To advance a common set of ideas that help to define the profession's orientation toward problems of information organization and access.

# Course Materials
There is no required textbook for this course; required articles and book chapters are available electronically,
through the UIUC Library's electronic reserves system (<https://reserves.library.illinois.edu/ares/>), the 
UIUC Library's e-journals search tool (<http://openurl.library.uiuc.edu/sfxlcl3/az>), or the open Web (as indicated).   


The textbook *The Discipline of Organizing* by Robert J. Glushko is recommended for those new to the field.
It provides a discussion of many of the concepts we will discuss in class, and can be accessed online at
<http://vufind.carli.illinois.edu/vf-uiu/Record/uiu_7572272>.

This course will introduce you to many terms and concepts that may be new to you.

# Assignment 1 Information Needs/Information Seeking Behavior {#Asgt1 .task}

Due September due date at 11:59 PM. This assignment is worth 20 points.

## Rationale {.context}

The purpose of this exercise is two-fold. First, it is intended to
allow you to examine the factors that condition the information needs
or influence the information seeking behavior of a specific user
group. Second, it affords you the opportunity to explore what types of
research methods are used to do research on concrete user groups. The
handout from the first lab of class will assist you with this
exercise. Methods Handout If you'd like to know more about the
method(s) in your article, you can refer to this Research Methods
portal: <http://InformationR.net/rm/>

## Tasks {.steps}

1. Select a category of information user that interests you (e. g., high
   school student, scientist, health care consumer, migrant farm worker).
2. Identify a published research study that investigates information
   needs and/or information seeking behavior of individuals from this
   population.

## Deliverable {.result}

In a brief essay of 600-700 words (1-2 pages) discuss your article's
research question, methods, findings, and implications for design of
information systems and services (in-person, web-based, or
both). Integrate relevant readings from those assigned for class and
especially those you have read to date (and from the users and information needs
session in particular) in support of your arguments.

## Submitting {.postreq}

1. Upload your essay to the Assignment 1 Moodle dropbox.
2. Post a one-paragraph summary of your article on the Assignment 1
   discussion forum.
3. Bring a copy of your article to class for small group discussion.

## Strategies for locating research studies {.section}

Articles indexed under the subject "Information needs" or
"Information-seeking behavior" in Library & Information Science Source:

- <http://www.library.illinois.edu/lsx/>
- <http://openurl.library.uiuc.edu/sfxlcl3/az>

Articles indexed under the descriptor "Information seeking behaviour"
or "User needs" in LISA:

- <http://www.library.uiuc.edu/orr/results.php?types=A&subject=29>

Studies need not be recently published, but an example of a recent
study of this type is the following:

>Darby, P.; Clough, P. (2013). Investigating the information-seeking
>behaviour of genealogists and family historians.  Journal of
>Information Science 39(1): 73-84.

>People are increasingly investigating their family history (or
>genealogy) as part of their everyday information-seeking
>activities. This paper provides insight into this behaviour and
>presents a new conceptual model that captures the stages of activity
>carried out during people’s lifelong family history research. The
>model offers a multi-phase view of the research process, intended to
>illustrate: (a) the different research phases themselves; (b) the
>inter-relationship between phases; (c) distinct phase-specific
>behaviours; and (d) phase-specific resource preferences. Data
>collected from amateur family historians by interview and
>questionnaire has helped to validate the model and provide insights
>into the information resources used. The findings complement existing
>knowledge about family history research and will benefit: family
>historians as they seek to navigate within the research process;
>providers of genealogical resources as they seek to better support
>users; and academics as they study information-seeking behaviours in
>various contexts.

To determine whether the full text of an article is available online,
search for the journal title
at: <http://openurl.library.uiuc.edu/sfxlcl3/az>. The text of the article
may also be freely available on the web (e. g., on the author’s web
site), so you might also try doing a Google search using the article
title.  If the text is not available online, you will need to request
a copy of the article. See the LibGuide for Online and Continuing
Education Student Resources from the Library:

# Assignment 2 Digital Collections Assessment {#Asgt2 .task}

## Summary {.shortdesc}

Pick one DPLA exhibition, or one Flickr gallery or one 
Europeana pinterest board as an exemplar for your analysis.
write a narrative assessment of the content, 
organization, and potential users and uses.

Due October due date at 11:59 PM. This assignment is worth 20 points.

## Before you begin {.prereq}

Read the required assigned readings for our collections topic before starting this assignment.
The background readings will also make your task easier.

## Rationale {.context}

The reading and discussion topic for week 5 is the nature of collections, challenges we face in making
their contents accessible, and ways in which perspectives of librarians, archivists, and information
scientists contribute to meeting those challenges. In bringing a critical, reviewer's attention to an 
existing digital collection, those issues will become more vivid and understandable to you.

## Tasks {.steps}  

 1. Pick a topic of interest to you; perhaps something related to your final project. 
 2. Browse across these three differing approaches to digital collections:
    - [DPLA exhibitions](http://dp.la/exhibitions) (28 exhibitions) 
    - [FLICKR galleries](https://www.flickr.com/photos/flickr/galleries) (there are 322) 
    - [Europeana Pinterest boards](https://www.pinterest.com/europeana/) (74 boards).
 3. For the exemplar you select, write a narrative assessment of the content, 
    organization, and potential users and uses. Include the following considerations:
    - How easy was it for you to find your exemplar? 
    - Was it hard to determine what individual or institution is responsible for your exemplar?
    - Would it be appropriate to call your exemplar a collection? If so, why? If not, why not?
    - What categories of users is your exemplar intended to serve?
    - How would you characterize the content and scope of your exemplar? 
    - Can a user easily grasp the scope and arrangement? 
    - How do the available content and organization serve the needs of the intended users? 
    - Does the exemplar meet or exceed expectations for accessibility?

## Deliverables {.result}

The essay should be a 750-800 word evaluative essay with an introduction and 
conclusion. Integrate relevant readings in support of your arguments as appropriate.
PDF, docx, and Pandoc markdown are all acceptable file formats. Pandoc 
expression requires a separate bibliography file, unless your references 
and citations are formatted at the markdown source level 
(by hand, via Zotero, etc.).

## Submitting {.postreq}
Upload the essay to the Moodle section designated for this assignment.
