<h1 id="course-description">Course Description</h1>
<p>This course provides an intensive and thorough introduction to fundamentals of information organization and access from the point of view of the field of library and information science. The course is not an introduction to LIS as a whole or to the profession of librarianship--the focus is squarely on information organization and access. 501 aims to acquaint you with the principal problems of information organization and access, the main streams of thought, and the key thinkers and contributors. The material covered is broad in scope and applicable to a wide variety of settings and systems. The course emphasizes the central position of people, communities, and information users in problems of information organization and access.</p>
<h1 id="course-overview">Course Overview</h1>
<p>The central themes of the course are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Who uses information, how they use it, and what constraints shape their use of information;</li>
<li>How recorded knowledge can be organized and structured;<br />
</li>
<li>Ways of providing access to the world's knowledge.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="learning-objectives">Learning Objectives</h1>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>To provide a foundation for further study in library and information science, including an appreciation for forms of systematic research in LIS.</li>
<li>To introduce central concepts, theories, principles, research issues, and people associated with the practice and study of information organization and access.</li>
<li>To advance a common set of ideas that help to define the profession's orientation toward problems of information organization and access.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="course-materials">Course Materials</h1>

<h1 id="Asgt1" class="task">Assignment 1 Information Needs/Information Seeking Behavior</h1>
<p>Due September due date at 11:59 PM. This assignment is worth 20 points.</p>
<h2 id="rationale" class="context">Rationale</h2>
<p>The purpose of this exercise is two-fold. First, it is intended to allow you to examine the factors that condition the information needs or influence the information seeking behavior of a specific user group. Second, it affords you the opportunity to explore what types of research methods are used to do research on concrete user groups. The handout from the first lab of class will assist you with this exercise. Methods Handout If you'd like to know more about the method(s) in your article, you can refer to this Research Methods portal: <a href="http://InformationR.net/rm/" class="uri">http://InformationR.net/rm/</a></p>
<h2 id="tasks" class="steps">Tasks</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Select a category of information user that interests you (e. g., high school student, scientist, health care consumer, migrant farm worker).</li>
<li>Identify a published research study that investigates information needs and/or information seeking behavior of individuals from this population.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="deliverable" class="result">Deliverable</h2>
<p>In a brief essay of 600-700 words (1-2 pages) discuss your article's research question, methods, findings, and implications for design of information systems and services (in-person, web-based, or both). Integrate relevant readings from those assigned for class and especially those you have read to date (and from the users and information needs session in particular) in support of your arguments.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Darby, P.; Clough, P. (2013). Investigating the information-seeking behaviour of genealogists and family historians. Journal of Information Science 39(1): 73-84.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>People are increasingly investigating their family history (or genealogy) as part of their everyday information-seeking activities. This paper provides insight into this behaviour and presents a new conceptual model that captures the stages of activity carried out during people’s lifelong family history research. The model offers a multi-phase view of the research process, intended to illustrate: (a) the different research phases themselves; (b) the inter-relationship between phases; (c) distinct phase-specific behaviours; and (d) phase-specific resource preferences. Data collected from amateur family historians by interview and questionnaire has helped to validate the model and provide insights into the information resources used. The findings complement existing knowledge about family history research and will benefit: family historians as they seek to navigate within the research process; providers of genealogical resources as they seek to better support users; and academics as they study information-seeking behaviours in various contexts.</p>

It consists of a controlled list of main headings, many with subdivisions, with a rich system of cross references. It is supported by the U.S. government, and undergoes systematic revision. In recent decades its managers have begun to confront challenges such as biased terminology, complicated syntax (how terms are put together to form headings), and effective displays in electronic media. Many suggestions have been made for its improvement, including moving to a fully faceted system.</p>

Due to an increasing volume of published materials and the explosion of online information resources during the Internet age, the library does not currently provide centralized access to its various information silos, nor does it provide a user-friendly search and retrieval experience for users whose expectations are shaped by Google and other major commercial Web sites. Searching across library resources is a complicated task, bearing high-attention “transaction costs” for the user, which discourage the use of library resources. Libraries need access systems that minimize complexity, easing discovery and delivery of resources for user populations. Here, the authors review past efforts of centralization of access, consider the potential of next-generation catalogues in the context of this historical tendency toward centralization of access, and describe what goals underlie that centralization.</p>

It is argued that the actual elements of typical browsing episodes have not been well captured by common approaches to the concept to date. Method. Empirical research results reported by previous researchers are presented and closely analysed. Analysis. Based on the issues raised by the above research review, the components of browsing are closely analysed and developed. Browsing is seen to consist of a series of four steps, iterated indefinitely until the end of a browsing episode: 1) glimpsing a field of vision, 2) selecting or sampling a physical or informational object within the field of vision, 3) examining the object, 4) acquiring the object (conceptually and/or physically) or abandoning it. Not all of these elements need be present in every browsing episode, though multiple glimpses are seen to be the minimum to constitute the act. Results. This concept of browsing is then shown to have persuasive support in the psychological and anthropological literature, where research on visual search, curiosity and exploratory behaviour all find harmony with this perspective. Conclusion. It is argued that this conception of browsing is closer to real human behaviour than other approaches. Implications for better information system design are developed.</p>

The article considers the changing contexts of information communication, with some caveats about the identification of “pathologies of information”, and analyses the changes over time in the way in which issues of the quantity and quality of information available have been regarded. Two main classes of problems and issues are discussed. The first comprises issues relating to the quantity and diversity of information available: information overload, information anxiety, etc. The second comprises issues relating to the changing information environment with the advent of Web 2.0: loss of identity and authority, emphasis on micro-chunking and shallow novelty, and the impermanence of information. A final section proposes some means of solution of problems and of improvements to the situation.</p>

This entry discusses theories for knowledge organization classifications using examples from a number of classification systems, but no one system is discussed at length. Instead, the entry is organized into sections that deal first with classificatory issues in general and then with theories of content, theories of structure, and theories of notation for knowledge organization classifications.</p>

This entry recounts its history and development from its genesis to the present time, leading up to an explanation of LCC structure, tables, and notation. It then considers the system’s potential for wider application in the online age, through speculation on using LCC as a tool for (a) partitioning large files; (b) generating domain-specific taxonomies; and (c) integrating classification and controlled subject terms for improved retrieval in the online public access catalog (OPAC) and the Internet. Finally, analyzing both its strong and relatively weak features, it addresses the question of whether in its current state LCC is in all respects ready for playing such roles.</p>

Empirical evidence for convenience as a critical factor is explored in the data from two multi-year, user study projects funded by the Institute of Museum and Library Services. The theoretical framework for this understanding is founded in the concepts of bounded rationality and rational choice theory, with Savolainen’s (2006) concept of time as a context in information seeking, as well as gratification theory, informing the emphasis on the seekers’ time horizons. Convenience is a situational criterion in peoples’ choices and actions during all stages of the information-seeking process. The concept of convenience can include their choice of an information source, their satisfaction with the source and its ease of use, and their time horizon in information seeking. The centrality of convenience is especially prevalent among the younger subjects (“millennials”) in both studies, but also holds across all demographic categories—age, gender, academic role, or user or non-user of virtual reference services. These two studies further indicate that convenience is a factor for making choices in a variety of situations, including both academic information seeking and everyday-life information seeking, although it plays different roles in different situations.</p>

While still evolving and generating much discussion about its nature and standards for its evaluation, MMR has been employed in the social and behavioral sciences for more than three decades. It is already considered the third approach to research, along with the quantitative and qualitative approaches. How did this approach shape research in LIS? An analysis of 465 articles published in four major LIS research journals revealed that 22 articles (5%) employed MMR. However, the recognition of MMR by name or as a research method was absent from these articles and from the methodological literature in LIS. The various strengths of MMR suggest that being cognizant of its possible use in LIS would benefit researchers in the field.</p>

We describe basic theories of human development to explain the specifics of young users, i.e., their cognitive skills, fine motor skills, knowledge, memory and emotional states in so far as they differ from those of adults. We derive the implications these differences have on the design of information retrieval systems for children. Furthermore, we summarize the main findings about children’s search behavior from multiple user studies. These findings are important to understand children’s information needs, their search strategies and usage of information retrieval systems. We also identify several weaknesses of previous user studies about children’s information-seeking behavior. Guided by the findings of these user studies, we describe challenges for the design of information retrieval systems for young users. We give an overview of algorithms and user interface concepts. We also describe existing information retrieval systems for children, in specific web search engines and digital libraries. We conclude with a discussion of open issues and directions for further research. The survey provided in this paper is important both for designers of information retrieval systems for young users as well as for researchers who start working in this field.</p>

Areas were libraries will benefit by making their data work harder include collaborative collection management, collection views, library decision-making, user behavior and trend spotting. Extensive information about one’s own library as well as outside resources can help make resources more useful.</p>

Retrieved from <a href="https://journal.lib.uoguelph.ca/index.php/perj/article/view/1427" class="uri">https://journal.lib.uoguelph.ca/index.php/perj/article/view/1427</a>Due to the lack of published information (especially in Canada) on modified classification systems and thesauri for describing and organizing Aboriginal materials, I set out to conduct a survey on this topic. The surveys were distributed at five Indigenous-related conferences and gatherings in Canada and the United States between the Fall, 2009, and the Fall, 2010, and more than 50 completed surveys were collected. Research findings included preferred changes in terminology from Library of Congress subject headings (which were seen to be outdated and inappropriate) but there was no resounding consensus on a “one-size fits all” terminology for thesauri terminology. However, this was not seen to be problematic given the diverse range of participants who took part in the survey. Respondents also commented on a survey question inquiring about the use of the “Medicine Wheel” concept as a way to organize Aboriginal-related materials, as well as other possible structures that might prove more culturally relevant for organizing these materials. There was both support for and strong opposition to the use of the Medicine Wheel for this purpose, for a variety of reasons. Participants indicated a preference for non-hierarchical and less linear structures than what current mainstream classification systems provide. There also seemed to be support for “landscape-based” structures. Although research findings were not conclusive, some valuable insights were gained from this study. The exploratory nature of this research project suggests more research (and more in-depth research) in this area is required.</p>

His obsession was to classify, encode and unify books and documents published all over the world. Over the years, he and his staff would fill in 12 million index cards. His classification system is regarded today as similar to hypertext, which enables us to navigate the internet. A pacifist and an internationalist, Otlet was one of the driving forces behind the League of Nations. He persuaded the architect Le Corbusier to design a World City dedicated to Peace, Knowledge and Fraternity. This beautiful film interweaves a vast fund of recently discovered documents from his archive with autobiographical material to create a fascinating piece of intellectual history.</p>

In this article, we note an unfortunate antiscientific bias in contemporary writings that proclaim the value of qualitative approaches for studying information problems. We critique such claims in terms of five key methodological concerns: (1) scientific versus nonscientific traditions; (2) the distinction between emic and etic perspectives; (3) the artificial divide between qualitative and quantitative techniques; (4) inductive versus deductive research strategies; and (5) the challenges of portraying real people in scientific reports. After evaluating a selection of published research on reference service performance, we conclude that library and information science investigators should turn to scientific ethnography to escape methodological impasses.</p>

The relative absence of social cues in the virtual environment may mean greater equality of services though at the same time greater inequalities may arise as librarians can become less self-aware online. Findings indicate that the quality of service librarians provide to African Americans and Arabs is lower than the quality of service they provide to Caucasian, Hispanic, Asian, and Jewish students. This study adds to the knowledge of subjective bias in the virtual environment by specifying those that are discriminated against online, identifying the kinds of discriminatory actions of virtual reference librarians, and identifying the type of queries that more frequently result in unbiased service.</p>

With the increasing availability of digitized content, and the development of shared print repositories, our perceived obligation to the preservation of individual print copies at an institutional level is shifting to a more shared model. Library preservation professionals must now determine how this is influencing our day to day practices. This paper reviews the data collected from a 2012 survey and interprets that data to show how the availability of digital surrogates, libraries’ increasing consideration of shared print holdings, and the perceived value of scarcely held content are all influencing preservation selection.

The origin of the field as a potential aid to the development of library and information services is noted, as is the transition from this status to that of a subject for research at PhD level and beyond. The development of the field has thus led to a division between the needs of academia for theoretically grounded work, and the needs of the field of practice for guidance for service development. There is, today, a disconnection between research and practice, to a significant extent: early research was undertaken by practitioners but today academic research dominates the scene. Suggestions are made as to how this disconnection can be repaired.</p>
