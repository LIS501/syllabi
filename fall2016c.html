<h1 id="course-description">Course Description</h1>
<p>This course provides an intensive and thorough introduction to fundamentals of information organization and access from the point of view of the field of library and information science. The course is not an introduction to LIS as a whole or to the profession of librarianship--the focus is squarely on information organization and access. 501 aims to acquaint you with the principal problems of information organization and access, the main streams of thought, and the key thinkers and contributors. The material covered is broad in scope and applicable to a wide variety of settings and systems. The course emphasizes the central position of people, communities, and information users in problems of information organization and access.</p>
<h1 id="course-overview">Course Overview</h1>
<p>The central themes of the course are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Who uses information, how they use it, and what constraints shape their use of information;</li>
<li>How recorded knowledge can be organized and structured;<br />
</li>
<li>Ways of providing access to the world's knowledge.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="learning-objectives">Learning Objectives</h1>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>To provide a foundation for further study in library and information science, including an appreciation for forms of systematic research in LIS.</li>
<li>To introduce central concepts, theories, principles, research issues, and people associated with the practice and study of information organization and access.</li>
<li>To advance a common set of ideas that help to define the profession's orientation toward problems of information organization and access.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="course-materials">Course Materials</h1>
<p>There is no required textbook for this course; required articles and book chapters are available electronically, through the UIUC Library's electronic reserves system (<a href="https://reserves.library.illinois.edu/ares/" class="uri">https://reserves.library.illinois.edu/ares/</a>), the UIUC Library's e-journals search tool (<a href="http://openurl.library.uiuc.edu/sfxlcl3/az" class="uri">http://openurl.library.uiuc.edu/sfxlcl3/az</a>), or the open Web (as indicated).</p>

<h1 id="Asgt1" class="task">Assignment 1 Information Needs/Information Seeking Behavior</h1>
<p>Due September due date at 11:59 PM. This assignment is worth 20 points.</p>
<h2 id="rationale" class="context">Rationale</h2>
<p>The purpose of this exercise is two-fold. First, it is intended to allow you to examine the factors that condition the information needs or influence the information seeking behavior of a specific user group. Second, it affords you the opportunity to explore what types of research methods are used to do research on concrete user groups. The handout from the first lab of class will assist you with this exercise. Methods Handout If you'd like to know more about the method(s) in your article, you can refer to this Research Methods portal: <a href="http://InformationR.net/rm/" class="uri">http://InformationR.net/rm/</a></p>
<h2 id="tasks" class="steps">Tasks</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Select a category of information user that interests you (e. g., high school student, scientist, health care consumer, migrant farm worker).</li>
<li>Identify a published research study that investigates information needs and/or information seeking behavior of individuals from this population.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="deliverable" class="result">Deliverable</h2>
<p>In a brief essay of 600-700 words (1-2 pages) discuss your article's research question, methods, findings, and implications for design of information systems and services (in-person, web-based, or both). Integrate relevant readings from those assigned for class and especially those you have read to date (and from the users and information needs session in particular) in support of your arguments.</p>
<h2 id="submitting" class="postreq">Submitting</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Upload your essay to the Assignment 1 Moodle dropbox.</li>
<li>Post a one-paragraph summary of your article on the Assignment 1 discussion forum.</li>
<li>Bring a copy of your article to class for small group discussion.</li>

<p>Darby, P.; Clough, P. (2013). Investigating the information-seeking behaviour of genealogists and family historians. Journal of Information Science 39(1): 73-84.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>People are increasingly investigating their family history (or genealogy) as part of their everyday information-seeking activities. This paper provides insight into this behaviour and presents a new conceptual model that captures the stages of activity carried out during people’s lifelong family history research. The model offers a multi-phase view of the research process, intended to illustrate: (a) the different research phases themselves; (b) the inter-relationship between phases; (c) distinct phase-specific behaviours; and (d) phase-specific resource preferences. Data collected from amateur family historians by interview and questionnaire has helped to validate the model and provide insights into the information resources used. The findings complement existing knowledge about family history research and will benefit: family historians as they seek to navigate within the research process; providers of genealogical resources as they seek to better support users; and academics as they study information-seeking behaviours in various contexts.</p>
