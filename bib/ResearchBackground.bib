	abstract = {Mixed methods research (MMR)—which integrates qualitative and quantitative methods in one study to improve the study's quality—is not common in library and information science (LIS) and has not been discussed in its literature. While still evolving and generating much discussion about its nature and standards for its evaluation, MMR has been employed in the social and behavioral sciences for more than three decades. It is already considered the third approach to research, along with the quantitative and qualitative approaches. How did this approach shape research in LIS? An analysis of 465 articles published in four major LIS research journals revealed that 22 articles (5\%) employed MMR. However, the recognition of MMR by name or as a research method was absent from these articles and from the methodological literature in LIS. The various strengths of MMR suggest that being cognizant of its possible use in LIS would benefit researchers in the field.},

	abstract = {Qualitative methodologies are growing in importance for library and information science researchers. In this article, we note an unfortunate antiscientific bias in contemporary writings that proclaim the value of qualitative approaches for studying information problems. We critique such claims in terms of five key methodological concerns: (1) scientific versus nonscientific traditions; (2) the distinction between emic and etic perspectives; (3) the artificial divide between qualitative and quantitative techniques; (4) inductive versus deductive research strategies; and (5) the challenges of portraying real people in scientific reports. After evaluating a selection of published research on reference service performance, we conclude that library and information science investigators should turn to scientific ethnography to escape methodological impasses.},
